LEGISLATION


The Law on Public Information and Media, Official Gazzette No. 83/2014, August 13, 2014.
 
[(1) This law regulates inter alia the freedom to gather, publish and receive information, freedom to form and express ideas and opinions, as well as freedom of sharing information and ideas through the internet and other platforms.
 
(2) Article 29, par. 1 defines media as a means of public information which by words, images or sound transmits edited information, ideas and opinions and other sort of content intended for public distribution and to an unspecified number of users.

Therefore, apparently, this law would apply to online intermediaries only under these narrow circumstances.

(5) Article 75 specifically provides for the prevention of hate speech by stating that ideas, opinions, or information published in media, must not encourage discrimination, hate or violence against any person or group of persons due to their race or not belonging to certain race, religion, nation, gender, sexual preferences, or any other personal characteristic, irrespective of whether by publishing such information a criminal offence has been committed or not.
 
(6) However, Article 76 provides that there is no breach of Article 75, if the information allegedly violating Article 75 is a part of a journalistic article and has been published:
without an intention to encourage discrimination, hate or violence against person or a group of persons, especially if such information is a part of an objective journalistic report;
with an intention to critically expose discrimination, hate or violence  against a person or a group of persons, or to expose statements that represent or might represent an encouragement to such behavior.
 
(7) Finally, the law emphasizes special protections of juveniles, so that media content must not harm their moral, intellectual, emotional, and social development.

[providing that the President of the District Court (""Tribunal d'arrondissement"") may issue an interim injunction, upon request of a person authorised to file an action for counterfeiting, against an intermediary whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right designed to:
prevent any imminent infringement to an intellectual property right;
prohibit, on a temporary basis, the pursuit of the alleged infringements to an intellectual property right;
subordinate the pursuit of the alleged infringements to the constitution of guarantees designed to ensure the indemnification of the requesting party; or

Law on the Freedom of Expression in the Media, as amended, June 8, 2004
 
[providing that the civil or criminal liability for any infringement committed by way of a media lies on the contributor, if known, or by default, on the editor, or by default, on the diffuser (art 21). The notion of diffuser covers the intermediary providers as defined by articles 60, 61 and 62 of the law of 14 August 2000, as amended, on E-commerce (art 3(2)). Such infringements concerned, for example, infringements to privacy (art 14(1)), to the reputation or honor (art 16) or to the protection of minors (art 18)]
 

Law on Copyrights, Related Rights and Databases, as amended, April 18, 2001

This cascading principle established a successive and isolated liability between the authors and co-authors of press-related offences and excludes the traditional principles of the civil law regarding tortious liability. In the present case, the author of the offence was identified and therefore, by application of article 21 of the law of 8 June 2004, as amended, on the freedom of expression in the media, his liability only should be retained]

LEGISLATION


Information Society Services Act, May 1, 2004 
 
[The Information Society Services Act (ISSA), which is based on the EU e-Commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EC), lists three types on services the providers which are exempted from potential liability under certain conditions: (i) mere transmission and access to public data communications network providers (Section 8 ISSA); (ii) caching providers (Section 9 ISSA); and (iii) hosting providers (Section 10 ISSA). The Act also stipulates that the service providers in the meaning of Sections 8 to 10 are not required to monitor the information transmitted or stored by them or search any illegal activity (Section 11 ISSA).]
 
Copyright Act, December 12, 1992 
 
[Section 817 of Copyright Act stipulates that in the case of the unlawful use of a work or an object of related rights, the author or holder of related rights may, among other, claim termination of the unlawful use of a work or an object of related rights and refrainment from further violation pursuant to Section 1055 of the Law of Obligations Act].
 
Law of Obligations Act, July 1, 2002 
 
[The Law of Obligations Act (LOA) implements Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC). If unlawful damage is caused by violation of copyright or related rights or violation of industrial property right, the person whose rights are violated may request that the violator and the person whose services a third party used for the purpose of violation of the right be refrained from further violation. (Section 1055(3) LOA)].


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS


The draft Copyright Act, July 19, 2014

The Law of Obligations Act will not, however, be amended in relevant respect. Therefore, in essence no changes are introduced. The estimated time of entry into force of the new Copyright Act is 1 January 2017].


DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Supreme Court, Civil, Case No. 3-2-1-43-09, Delfi case, June 10, 2009 
[defamation, hosting provider, news portal, comment section, liability]
 
[(1) The case arose when a popular news portal (Delfi) in Estonia published an article about the ferry connection with the islands in Estonia. The news portal enabled users to comment on news articles. Among the comments were 20 comments that according to the claimant, the majority shareholder of the ferry transport company concerned, infringed his personality rights. The claimant argued that the news portal is liable for the damage incurred. Although Delfi implemented pre-examination of comments (if comments included specific vulgar expressions, the comment was not published), this was seen as an ineffective measure.
 
(2) The Supreme Court upheld previous judgments and reiterated that (i) Delfi is a provider of content services. As such, Delfi governs the content that is stored and should be distinguished from an information service provider, falling under the e-Commerce Directive's Article 14 and its Estonian national implementation (Section 10 of the ISSA), which has neither knowledge of nor control over information which is transmitted or stored. (ii) By integrating the comment environment into its news portal and inviting users to post comments, Delfi could decide which comments to publish or not.  The fact that Delfi did not use this capability did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of comments. In the Supreme Court’s view, because Delfi had a legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other persons, Delfi should have prevented unlawful comments from being published. (iii) Additionally, Delfi acted out of economic considerations and as such, the ISP cannot be seen as acting neutrally. (iv) Finally, the Estonian Supreme Court noted that both Delfi and the authors of the comments could be considered publishers of the comments. Therefore, the defamed party was free to choose against whom to bring the lawsuit.
 
(3) The case was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) where the First Section of the ECtHR issued its judgment on 10 October 2013. The case was referred to the Grand Chamber on 17 February 2014 and the judgment of the Grand Chamber was issued on 16 June 2015. The Grand Chamber found that the judgement of the Supreme Court of Estonia finding that Delfi is liable for the offensive comments had been a justified and proportionate restriction on the portal’s freedom of expression and the steps taken by Delfi to remove offensive comments without delay after their publication had been insufficient.
 


Lower Courts


Circuit Court of Tallinn, Civil, Case No. 2-08-76058/74, February 21, 2012
[defamation, hosting provider, news portal, comment section, liability]
 
[(1) The court ruled that the news portal that enabled commenting news articles published at its websites did not act neutrally (the activities of the ISP were not merely technical, automatic and passive in nature) as required under Section 10 of the ISSA (Section 14 of the e-Commerce Directive) and therefore the news portal could not benefit from the exemption of liability. 
 
(2) The court found that the Supreme Court in the Delfi case had reached a similar conclusion than the European Court of Justice in the Google AdWords case (C-236/08 to C-238/08) meaning that if an enterprise is not providing a service that is of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature, the enterprise cannot be exempted from liability.]
 
Harju County Court of Harju, Civil, Case No. 2-05-22224/34, November 30, 2007
[defamation, hosting provider, news portal, exemption from liability]
 
[The court found that news portals which enabled uncensored commenting at its website were not liable for the activities of the users of the news portal under Sections 10 and 11 of the ISSA. The court suggested the claimant filed a claim against the commentator which could be identified with the help of the ISP publishing the article.]

Regulation on Mandatory Filtering Measures to be Used at Locations of Public Access to Internet, approved by the Government Resolution No. 463 on April 28, 2010.
 
[The Regulation requires all internet service providers who offer access to internet at public places to install mandatory filtering measures approved by the Information Society Development Committee under the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The legal basis for information filtering is the Law on the Protection of Minors Against the Detrimental Effect of Public Information, and measures are focused on filtering of information harmful for minors.]
 
Regulation on Denial of Access to Information which was Acquired, Created, Modified or Used Illegally, approved by the Government Resolution No. 881 on August 22, 2007
 
[(1) The Regulation provides for detailed procedure and steps to be followed by service providers in dealing with take down requests against illegal content.
 
(2) The service providers are required to forward the take down request to the service recipient within 4 working days and wait for the response. If response is not received, the service provider must deny access to the information. However, if the service recipient responds and disagrees with the take down request, the service provider must evaluate if disagreement is justified and then decide if to take down the requested information.
 
(3) The Regulation imposes an unusual obligation on the service provider to evaluate the justification of a take down request; however, the provider may apply to competent institution (the Information Society Development Committee under the Ministry of Transport and Communications) for clarification if there are doubts about legality of the information requested to be taken down.]
 
Law No. X-614 On Information Society Services, as amended, May 25, 2006 
 
[The law implements the Ecommerce Directive 2000/31/EC transposing the provisions on liability of intermediaries (mere conduit, caching and hosting) (Articles 12 to 14) almost identically to the directive (Articles 12-14 of the law).
 
Law No. VIII-1185 on Copyright and Related Rights, as amended, May 18, 1999 
 
[The law implements the Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. (1) Article 78 of the law provides for the right of the rightholders to apply to court for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related rights. (2) Intermediaries are defined as electronic communication service providers who transmit information provided by third parties, provide access to communication networks and/or store information.]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Supreme Court of Lithuania, Civil Case No. 3K-3-49/2013, February 27, 2013
[defamation, no obligation to monitor, non-pecuniary damage]
 
[(1) Applicants sought the court to declare information disseminated on a website as false, offending honour and dignity and business reputation and to adjudge non-pecuniary damages.
 
(2) The court ruled that according to the Law on Information Society Services the intermediary has no obligation to monitor the information which he transmits or stores or to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activities, but after receiving information about the illegal activities or storing illegally acquired, created, modified, or used information, intermediaries are obliged to take active actions under the law. Since the defendant received the applicant’s notification about unlawful data being hosted at the service provider’s website, but acted passively and did not take any action to evaluate the report and thus contributed to the dissemination of the data, limitation of liability foreseen by the Law on Information Society Services does not apply. Therefore, the service provider is liable in accordance with general rules on civil liability.]
 
Supreme Court of Lithuania, Civil Case No. 3K-3-586/2012, December 21, 2012 
[active intermediary, passive intermediary, hosting provider, transmission, storage, take-down request]
 
[(1) The court explained that claim against an information society service provider for removal of illegal information can be made regardless of whether he is a passive intermediary (when his activity is of technical, automatic, and passive nature), or actively collects information about the service recipients. This distinction is relevant only for determining the liability of the service provider. If service provider plays an active role so that it has knowledge or control of the hosted data, such service provide can be held liable for dissemination of unlawful information, and limitation of liability which is applicable to hosting intermediaries, does not apply to such active service provider.
 
(2) The court also clarified that take down requests must be resolved even if the service recipient is unknown or does not participate in the proceedings.
 
(3) The obligation to remove transmitted and (or) stored illegal information cannot be identified as a defining the application of legal liability (civil, administrative, criminal) of a service provider for illegal information storage and dissemination. The request to remove illegal information from a web page is an independent legal remedy for non-pecuniary damage (i.e. non-contractual liability) thus fewer facts must to be met in order to adjust the claim and it does not depend on the application of civil liability of the information society service provider. When requiring to remove transmitted and (or) stored illegal information, circumstances that must to be proved are: the illegality (sensitivity) of the information, the fact of transmission and (or) storage and the fact that the defendant is an information society service provider].
 
Supreme Court of Lithuania, Civil Case No. 3K-3-479/2012, November 13, 2012
[defamation, hosting service provider, consumers' complaints, take-down]
 
[(1) The case focused on a take down request against a service provider that hosted a website dedicated to publishing consumers’ complaints. The claimant requested to disable publication of a complaint, which, according to claimant, was false. Although the website operator implemented a procedure, which allowed publication of complaints only after their approval, the court recognised the manager of the website to be a hosting service provider.
 
(2) The court decided that although the service provider refused to comply with the take down request, a claim in court for removal of unlawful information may be directed against the service provider even if service provider has no liability for the information published. It is for the court to make a final determination if the information is unlawful and order the claimant to remove it.]

 

Lower Courts


Vilnius Regional Court, Civil Case No. 2A-1049-577/2015, January 6, 2015; Civil Case No. 2A-1407-392/2015, May 4, 2015; 
[copyright, mere conduit, access provider, cable company, ISPs, peeep-to-peer]
 
[(1) In both cases, the claimant asked the court to find the communication service providers (cable network companies) liable for copyright infringement committed by its users, who downloaded infringing software via peer to peer networks.
 
(2) The court found that the respondent is an electronic communication service provider, who only transmits the electronic communication signals, does not control the content of data and therefore, enjoys an exemption from liability established by the Law on Information Society Services. The claim against the service provider was dismissed].
 
Kaunas Regional Court, Civil Case No. 2A-852-324/2012, May 24, 2012
[hosting provider, take-down request, notification, lack of response]
 
[The court decided that in cases when hosting service provider after receiving a take down request is not able to contact the user, who posted the content, the legal consequences should be equivalent to the case when service provider does not receive a reply form the user after notifying him of the received take down request. In such cases the service provider must disable access to the information in question].

Act No. 137 of 2001 on the Limitation of Liability for Damages of Specified Telecommunications Service Providers, November 30, 2001 (English Version)
 
[Article 3 sets forth a safe harbor for telecommunications service providers in the following circumstances:
 
(i) When any right of others is infringed by information distribution via specified telecommunications, the specified telecommunications service provider who uses specified telecommunications facilities for said specified telecommunications (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as a ""relevant service provider"") shall not be liable for any loss incurred from such infringement, unless where it is technically possible to take measures for preventing such information from being transmitted to unspecified persons and such event of infringement falls under any of the following items. However, where said relevant service provider is the sender of said information infringing rights, this shall not apply.
 
(ii) In cases where said relevant service provider knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.
 
(iii)  In cases where said relevant service provider had knowledge of information distribution by said specified telecommunications, and where there is a reasonable ground to find that said relevant service provider could know the infringement of the rights of others was caused by the information distribution via said specified telecommunications.]

Superior Courts



Supreme Court, Animal Hospital Case, October 7, 2005
[defamation, hosting provider, bulletin board, liability]
 
[Channel 2, a Japanese bulletin board, has tried to invoke the safe harbor in an online libel actions, claiming that as an operator it could not know or reasonably know that any given bulletin post was defamatory.  The Supreme Court rejected these arguments and found Channel 2 liable on the rationale that, given the large amount of defamatory and “unreliable” content in threads found on its site, it was not necessary for Channel 2 to know that each thread was defamatory, but it was sufficient that Channel 2 had the knowledge that there was a risk that such transmissions/posts could be defamatory.]

 

Lower Courts


IP High Court Decision, Heisei 22 (Ne) No. 10076, Rakuten case, February 14, 2012
[trademark, hosting provider, online shopping mall, liability]
 
[(1) In this litigation, a trademark holder brought a trademark infringement litigation against Rakuten K.K., the operator of the online shopping mall named “Rakuten Ichiba”, claiming that Rakuten's operation of the online mall constituted an infringement of the plaintiff's trademark rights.  Rakuten Ichiba is an Internet shopping mall where retailers can establish virtual stores.  Some of such virtual stores sold products that infringe the trademark rights of the trademark owner.
 
(2) Rakuten argued that (i) the seller of the infringing goods was each of the retailers who established a virtual store in Rakuten Ichiba, not Rakuten, and (ii) the role of Rakuten was merely to provide retailers with opportunity to make deals with customers.  In response, the trademark owner argued that, considering the involvement of Rakuten in the sale of the goods, Rakuten should be deemed to have sold the goods at least together with the retailer.  
 
(3) The Intellectual Property High Court (""IP High Court"") ruled in favor of Rakuten stating as follows: ""An operator of web pages who, not only puts in place certain environment that enables retailers to establish web pages but also provides the operating systems, controls or manages establishment, maintenance and deletion of each virtual store, and obtains a benefit by requiring a store opening fee and a usage fee from the retailers, should be liable for infringement of trademark rights when it became aware of or there were reasonable grounds to find that the operator could become aware of the trademark infringement by the retailers; unless the operator deleted the web page constituting the infringement within a reasonable period after it became or could become aware of the infringement."" In this case, the IP High Court concluded that, since Rakuten deleted the web pages within a reasonable period -- eight days from the time Rakuten became aware of the trademark infringement -- Rakuten was not liable for trademark infringement. Although this is a trademark infringement case, the Supreme Court's discussion concerning the online store's liability for user's IP infringement would similarly apply to copyright infringement and intermediary liability.]
 
Tokyo High Court Decision, File Rogue case, March 31, 2005, upholding Tokyo District Court, December 17, 2003
[copyright, hosting provider, peer-to-peer, music data, liability]
 
[(1) The File Rogue case further developed the NiftyServe decision (see below).  In this case, a company named Japan MMO started a service named “File Rogue”.  Japan MMO set up a server which collects, stores and distributes information concerning music data that each user of File Rogue owns, so that the users may exchange the music data using peer-to-peer data transmission application.  Actually, 96.7% of the music data exchanged by users using this service were illegal copies of music data.
 
(2) The Tokyo District stated that Japan MMO is liable for copyright infringement by users because (i) Japan MMO played an important role to collect and distribute information concerning users’ music data, (ii) it knew that most of the music data being exchanged by users were illegal copies that infringed copyright and (iii) did not take meaningful measures to delete infringing music data based on the “notice and takedown” procedure that Japan MMO claimed to have set up.]
 
Tokio High Court, Shogakan case, reversing Tokyo District Court, March 11, 2004
[copyright, hosting provider, bulletin board, liability]
 
[(1) With respect to a copyright infringement case involving Channel 2 where a user uploaded a small part of a copyrighted work onto the bulletin board, the Tokyo District Court held that Channel 2 only had a duty to remove works suspected of copyright infringement if it transmitted the infringing content or otherwise it was “obvious” the content infringed a third party’s copyright. The Tokyo District Court stated that Channel 2 was only an intermediary for transmitting third party information and that the sender of the email that contained the copyrighted work was the party that committed the unlawful act.  
 
(2) However, the appellant court (Tokyo High Court) reversed the Tokyo District Court decision and ruled that it was obvious that the uploaded contents are simply a copy of copyrighted work, and therefore Channel 2 had a duty to remove the works.]
 
Tokyo High Court Decision, NiftyServe Modern Thought Forum Case, September 5, 2001 (reversing Tokyo District Court, May 27, 1997)
[defamation, hosting provider, broadcasting board service, liability]
 
[(1) The issue of whether a party which merely administers or maintains a website or other online forums in which users or attendees committed illegal activities may be held liable for the illegal activities, was first discussed in Japan in the NiftyServe case.  In this case, a user of an online Broadcasting Board Service brought a lawsuit against another user who posted a libelous statement on the Broadcasting Board System.  The user also sued the administrator of the Broadcasting Board Service and the service provider company of the System, NiftyServe.
 
(2) The District Court found that the user’s posting of a libelous statement constitutes a tort and the user is liable to damages caused by such a statement.  The District Court also stated that the administrator was also liable for damages because it did not take appropriate measures such as deleting the statement long after becoming aware of the libelous statement on the Broadcasting Board System.  The Tokyo District Court further held Nifty Serve liable for damages as the entity under whose authority the administrator operated. 
 
(3) The parties appealed to the Tokyo High Court, which reversed the decision, stating that although in certain situations, the administrator and Nifty Serve should delete the libelous statement. In the present case, the administrator’s action was not too late.]
 
Tokyo District Court, Toritsu University case, September 24, 1999
[defamation, hosting provider, webpage, liability]
 
[(1) In this case, an individual placed on a university’s website, a webpage that contained defamation of another. The plaintiff sought damages against both the one who built the webpage and the owner of the university, the City of Tokyo, the legal operator of the network that hosted the website.  
 
(2) The court found the defendant who posted the message liable, but refused to hold the City of Tokyo liable on the grounds that is was improper to impose on a party remote to the defamatory act, the duty to prevent its dissemination. The court reasoned that whether or not the network operator’s duty to prevent the occurrence of the tort arises depends on the nature of the case and should be reviewed on an individual basis. The court went on to note that even in the case where a network operator had knowledge of the fact of the actual transmission of a defamatory statement, making the operator bear a duty to prevent the transmission should be limited to extremely exceptional cases, when it would be clear “at a glance” with respect to the defamatory statement that the “attitude of the perpetrator was very vicious and the that the degree of the injury would be serious.”]

LEGISLATION
Republic Act No. 10175 (a.k.a. the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012),  September 12, 2012
 
(1) On Service Providers
 
(i) The law defines service provider as “any public or private entity that provides to users of its service the ability to communicate by means of a computer system” and “any other entity that processes or stores computer data on behalf of such communication service or users of such service” [Section 3(n)]. Other relevant terms defined by the law include “computer data”, “subscriber’s information”, and “traffic data"" [Section 3(e), (o) and (p)].
 
(ii) For law enforcement purposes, service providers are required to preserve computer data within a specified period. The mandatory retention period (6 months) may be extended pursuant to an order by a law enforcement authority (one-time extension for another 6 months) (Section 13).
 
(iii) Law enforcement authorities may thereafter compel the service provider to disclose such traffic data and subscriber information, as well as any other relevant data or information in its possession, pursuant to a court-issued warrant, within 72 hours from receipt of the order (Section 14).
 
(iv) To gain possession of and examine relevant computer data, law enforcement authorities also have the option of securing a search and seizure warrant, which may be then enforced against a computer user or service provider, as the case may be (Section 15).
 
(v) Once the mandatory data retention periods imposed by the law have expired, both service providers and law enforcement authorities are required to delete or destroy the computer data subject involved (Section 17).
 
(vi) A service provider’s failure to comply with an order issued by a law enforcement authority is punishable under the law. Section 20 is clear on this point:
 
""Noncompliance. — Failure to comply with the provisions of Chapter IV hereof specifically the orders from law enforcement authorities shall be punished as a violation of Presidential Decree No. 1829 with imprisonment of prision correctional in its maximum period or a fine of One hundred thousand pesos (Php100,000.00) or both, for each and every noncompliance with an order issued by law enforcement authorities."" (PD No. 1829, as referred to in the foregoing provision, refers to an old law penalizing acts constituting obstruction to the apprehension of suspects in a criminal investigation, or the prosecution of criminal offenses.)
 
(2) Miscellaneous Provisions
 
(i) To date, there is no available data to suggest if any of the punishable acts (i.e., illegal access, illegal interception, etc.) treated by the law as constituting cybercrimes may be held against a service provider or any intermediary liability. There is, however, one particular offense cited in the law that could pose the greatest challenge: “aiding or abetting in the commission of a cybercrime”. Section 5(a) reads: ""Aiding or Abetting in the Commission of Cybercrime. – Any person who willfully abets or aids in the commission of any of the offenses enumerated in this Act shall be held liable.""
 
(ii) If and when a service provider is held liable for any of the offenses prescribed by the law, a key provision—other than those prescribing the corresponding penalties—is that which accounts for corporate liability. In this wise, Section 9 is instructive:
""SEC. 9. Corporate Liability. — When any of the punishable acts herein defined are knowingly committed on behalf of or for the benefit of a juridical person, by a natural person acting either individually or as part of an organ of the juridical person, who has a leading position within, based on: (a) a power of representation of the juridical person provided the act committed falls within the scope of such authority; (b) an authority to take decisions on behalf of the juridical person: Provided, That the act committed falls within the scope of such authority; or (c) an authority to exercise control within the juridical person, the juridical person shall be held liable for a fine equivalent to at least double the fines imposable in Section 7 up to a maximum of Ten million pesos (PhP10,000,000.00).
If the commission of any of the punishable acts herein defined was made possible due to the lack of supervision or control by a natural person referred to and described in the preceding paragraph, for the benefit of that juridical person by a natural person acting under its authority, the juridical person shall be held liable for a fine equivalent to at least double the fines imposable in Section 7 up to a maximum of Five million pesos (PhP5,000,000.00).
The liability imposed on the juridical person shall be without prejudice to the criminal liability of the natural person who has committed the offense.""
 
(3) Relevant Provisions Declared Unconstitutional - In a recent decision by the country’s Supreme Court, Disini v Secretary of Justice (Febraury 11, 2014), Section 12 and 19 were stricken down and declared void for being unconstitutional (see below).]
 
Republic Act No. 9775 (a.k.a. the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009), November 17, 2009
 
[(1) On Internet Content Hosts
 
(i) Under the law, an internet content host is defined as any person who hosts or who proposes to host internet content in the Philippines [Section 3(f)]. Each one is bound to observe and perform certain specific duties, thus:

“Duties of an Internet Content Host. – An internet content host shall:
(a)   Not host any form of child pornography on its internet address;
(b)   Within seven (7) days, report the presence of any form of child pornography, as well as the particulars of the person maintaining, hosting, distributing or in any manner contributing to such internet address, to the proper authorities; and
(c)   Preserve such evidence for purposes of investigation and prosecution by relevant authorities.
An internet content host shall, upon the request of proper authorities, furnish the particulars of users who gained access to an internet address that contains any form of child pornography. 
An internet content host who shall knowingly, willfully and intentionally violate this provision shall be subject to the penalty provided under Section 15(j) of this Act: Provided, That the failure of the internet content host to remove any form of child pornography is hitting its server shall be conclusive evidence of willful and intentional violation thereof.” (Section 11)
 
(ii) For this purpose, Section 15(j) reads:
“Any person found guilty of violating Section 11 of this Act shall suffer the penalty of prison correccional in its medium period and a fine of not less than one million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) but not more than two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) for the first offense. In the case of a subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine not less than Two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) but not more than Three million pesos (Php3,000,000.00) and revocation of its license to operate and immediate closure of the establishment;”

 
(2) On Internet Service Providers
 
(i) On the other hand, an internet service provider (ISP) is defined as a “person or entity that supplies or proposes to supply, an internet carriage service to the public” [Section 3(g)]. Its duties under the law are, as follows:
“Duties of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). All internet service providers (ISPs) shall notify the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) within seven (7) days from obtaining facts and circumstances that any form of child pornography is being committed using its server or facility. Nothing in this section may be construed to require an ISP to engage in the monitoring of any user, subscriber or customer, or the content of any communication of any such person: Provided, That no ISP shall be held liable for damages on account of any notice given in good faith in compliance with this section.
Furthermore, an ISP shall preserve such evidence for purpose of investigation and prosecution by relevant authorities.
An ISP shall, upon the request of proper authorities, furnish the particulars of users who gained or attempted to gain access to an internet address which contains any form of child pornography.
All ISPs shall install available technology, program or software to ensure that access to or transmittal of any form of child pornography will be blocked or filtered.
An ISP who shall knowingly, willfully and intentionally violate this provision shall be subject to the penalty provided under Section 15(k) of this Act. 
The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) shall promulgate within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Act the necessary rules and regulations for the implementation of this provision which shall include, among others, the installation of filtering software that will block access to or transmission of any form of the child pornography.” (Section 9)
 
(ii) Section 15(k) of the law reads:
“Any ISP found guilty of willfully and knowingly failing to comply with the notice and installation requirements under Section 9 of this Act shall suffer the penalty of a fine not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (Php500,000.00) but not more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) for the first offense. In case of subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine of not less than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) but not more than Two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) and revocation of its license to operate.”
 
(3) On Telecommunications Companies
 
(i) Inasmuch as some telecommunications companies already operate as ISPs, and may therefore be held liable as such under the applicable provisions of the law, there is nevertheless a separate provision directed specifically at such entities. Section 4(f) of the law declares: 
“Unlawful or Prohibited Acts. – It shall be unlawful for any person:
(f) For film distributors, theaters and telecommunications companies, by themselves or in cooperation with other entities, to distribute any form of child pornography;”
(ii) The imposable penalty for such violation may be found in Section 15(c) of the law:
“Any person found guilty of violating Section (d), (e), and (f) of this Act shall suffer the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period and a fine of not less than seven hundred fifty thousand pesos (Php750,000.00) but not more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00);”
(iii) It is unclear how else telecommunications companies may be expected to distribute child pornography other than by operating as ISPs.
 
(4) Miscellaneous Provisions
 
(i) Where the offender involved is a juridical person, the penalty shall be imposed upon the “owner, partner, member of the board of directors and/or any responsible officer who participated in the commission of the crime or shall have knowingly permitted or failed to prevent its commissions” (Section 16).
 
(ii) The law also mandates the confiscation and forfeiture of equipment used in child pornography. However, it is unclear if and how this applies to intermediaries who are held liable for violating the provisions of the law (Section 17).
 
(iii) It is also worth noting that under Section 6 of the more recently enacted law of Republic Act No. 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012) (see above), the imposable penalty for crimes defined and made punishable by the Revised Penal Code or a special law like Republic Act No. 9775, shall be one (1) degree higher than that provided by the RPC or special law concerned, if committed “by, through and with the use of information and communications technologies”.]
 
Republic Act No. 8792 (a.k.a. the Electronic Commerce Act), June 14, 2000
 
[(1) On Intermediaries
 
The law defines an intermediary as “a person who in behalf of another person and with respect to a particular electronic document sends, receives, and/or stores, provides other services in respect of that electronic data message or electronic document”. [Sec. 5(h)] However, except where it excludes this person from the concepts of “addressee” [see: Section 5(a)] and “originator” [see: Section 5(i)], the law makes no mention the term anywhere else in its text.
 
(2) On Service Providers
 
(ii) A service provider, on the other hand, is defined by the law in the following manner:

“’Service Provider’ refers to a provider of:
i. online services or network access or the operator of facilities therefor including entities offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for online communications, digital or otherwise, between or among points specified by a user of electronic documents of the user’s choosing; or
ii. the necessary technical means by which electronic documents of an originator may be stored and made accessible to designated or undesignated third party.
Such service providers shall have no authority to modify or alter the content of the electronic document received or to make any entry therein on behalf of the originator, addressee or any third party unless specifically authorized to do so, and who shall retain the electronic document in accordance with the specific request or as necessary for the purpose of performing the services it was engaged to perform.” [Section 5(i)]
(ii) Unlike in the case of an intermediary, an entire section is devoted to delineating the extent of liability of a service provider as regards a particular electronic data message or electronic document. Thus, Section 30 reads:
“Extent of Liability of a Service Provider. – Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no person or party shall be subject to any civil or criminal liability in respect of the electronic data message or electronic document for which the person or party acting as a service provider as defined in Section 5, merely provides access if such liability is founded on –
(a) The obligations and liabilities of the parties under the electronic data message or electronic document;
(b) The making, publication, dissemination or distribution of such material or any statement made in such material, including possible infringement of any right subsisting in or in relation to such material. Provided, That
i. The service provider does not have actual knowledge, or is not aware of the facts or circumstances from which it is apparent, that the making, publication, dissemination or distribution of each material is unlawful or infringes any rights subsisting in or in relation to such material;
ii. The service provider does not knowingly receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the unlawful or infringing activity; and
iii. The service provider does not directly commit any infringement or other unlawful act and does not induce or cause another person or party to commit any infringement or other unlawful act and/or does not benefit financially from the infringing activity or unlawful act or another person or party; Provider, further, That nothing in this Section shall affect –
a. Any obligation founded on contract;
b. The obligation of a service provider as such under a licensing or other regulatory regime established under written law;
c. Any obligation imposed under any written law;
d. The civil liability of any party to the extent that such liability forms the basis for injunctive relief issued by a court under any law requiring that the service provider take or refrain from action necessary to remove, block or deny access to any material, or to preserve evidence of a violation of law.”]

Superior Courts



Supreme Court, Disini v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 203335, February 11, 2014
[privacy, data retention, real-time collection, service providers, cooperation and assistance]
 
[In a recent decision by the country’s Supreme Court, two provisions of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (see above) were stricken down and declared void for being unconstitutional. 
 
(i) In its original text, the law provided for the real-time collection of traffic data by law enforcement authorities and service providers were required to “cooperate and assist law enforcement authorities in the collection or recording” of said traffic data. Section 12 previously read as:
""Real-Time Collection of Traffic Data. — Law enforcement authorities, with due cause, shall be authorized to collect or record by technical or electronic means traffic data in real-time associated with specified communications transmitted by means of a computer system.
Traffic data refer only to the communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service, but not content, nor identities.
All other data to be collected or seized or disclosed will require a court warrant.
Service providers are required to cooperate and assist law enforcement authorities in the collection or recording of the above-stated information.
The court warrant required under this section shall only be issued or granted upon written application and the examination under oath or affirmation of the applicant and the witnesses he may produce and the showing: (1) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that any of the crimes enumerated hereinabove has been committed, or is being committed, or is about to be committed: (2) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that evidence that will be obtained is essential to the conviction of any person for, or to the solution of, or to the prevention of, any such crimes; and (3) that there are no other means readily available for obtaining such evidence.""
(ii) Moreover, it also authorized the Department of Justice to order the blocking or restriction of access to a computer data if the latter is prima facie found to be in violation of the law. This is found under then Section 19: ""Restricting or Blocking Access to Computer Data. — When a computer data is prima facie found to be in violation of the provisions of this Act, the DOJ shall issue an order to restrict or block access to such computer data.""]

LEGISLATION


Law on Electronic Communications, January 01, 2008  [English version]
 
[(1) According to the Law on Electronic Communications (LEC), Information Service Providers (ISPs) are obliged to guarantee the confidentiality of communications by undertaking all the necessary technical and organizational measures. 
 
(2) The LEC provides for a data retention regime, which is only available to criminal enforcement authorities for serious crimes and computer crimes. Under Article 13(2) of LEC “the information shall not be stored for any period longer than the one that is reasonably necessary for the transmission."" Public authorities may rely also on the disclosure provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 
(3) ISPs are not supposed to disclose any information unless it is requested by the court, in connection to a particular civil, criminal or administrative case. Law on Electronic Commerce (LEC) does not stipulate an obligation for the ISPs to cooperate and disclose information.] 
 
Code of Civil Procedure, No. 59/2007, July 20, 2007 [English version]

 
[In a civil or administrative case the court can base a request of information disclosure either on Article 190 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) if the ISP is participating to the trial or on Article 192 (2) of CPC if the ISP is not participating to the trial and is therefore a third party.
 
(1) According Article 190 of CPC “each party may approach the court with a request to obligate the other party to present a document in the possession thereof, explaining the relevance of the said document to the dispute”. Article 191 (1) of CPC includes an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which the party could refuse to present the information requested  by the court under Article 190, including the case in which “this would lead to defamation or to criminal prosecution of the party or of any relatives”. 
 
(2) Under Article 192 (2) of CPC, if the ISP is a third party and  does not participate to the  trial, one of the parties can ask the court to issue a court order addressed to any third party, requesting them to disclose information which could be relevant for the trial. There are no grounds on which the ISP can deny to present the information requested unless he does not possess it. 
 
(3) If an ISP simply refuses to present the requested information to the  court, he faces only a fine, under Article 87 CPC, up to BGN 300 (approximately 166 USD). The fine for any breaches which impede the course of proceedings or which are re-committed shall be up to BGN 1,200 (approximately 666 USD), in a civil or administrative case (Article 91, CPC) or up to 1000 BGN (approximately 555 USD) in a criminal case (Article 133 (2), Criminal Procedure Code).]
 

Law on Electronic Commerce (spec. Art.13-18), December 24, 2006  [English version]
 
[(1) The liability of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is regulated by the Law on Electronic Commerce. The law is implementing the Directive 2000/31/EC (E-Commerce Directive) on electronic commerce regarding ISP liability. 
 
(2) The provisions of this act aim mainly to limit the liability of ISPs by explicitly determining the cases where an ISP might not be held liable, which differ depending on the type of services provided (i.e, hosting, linking, safekeeping in cache memory, etc). Further, the lack of a general monitoring obligation on ISPs is also stated as a principle, providing that the ISP is obliged neither to monitor the information which it stores, transmits or makes accessible in the process of provision of information society services, nor to look for facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity. 
 
(3) The provisions of the EU E-Commerce Directive regarding ISP liability and the EU Enforcement Directive 2004/48/EC are not fully implemented in the Law on Electronic Commerce, for example the requirements for the ISPs to terminate or prevent infringements upon an order by a court or administrative body, under Art. 12.3 and Art.15.2 of the E-Commerce, are not implemented yet.] [See also a Comparison between Intermediary Liability Legislation in Europe and Bulgaria by ILAC team, Nikola Penchev and Bianka Bikova.]
 
Personal Data Protection Act, January 01, 2002 [English version]
 
[(1) According to this Act, personal data shall be considered any information related to a natural person that has been identified or can be identified directly or indirectly through an identification number or through one or more specific indications. The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) generally implements the provisions of EU Directive 95/46 (the Data Protection Directive). Special regulations are provided in the Law on Electronic Communications (see above). 
 
(2) All the administrators or controllers of personal data are obliged to register as such with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). However, the administrator may commence processing once the application is filed (i.e., prior to the actual registration). 
 
(3) The PDPA provides that the collected data may be processed only in certain cases and for certain purposes, exhaustively listed in the act. A general prohibition on the processing of sensitive data (data that disclose race or ethnic origin, political, religious or philosophical beliefs, as well as data related to health, sexual life or the human genome) is also provided, listing the cases where this prohibition shall not apply.] 
 
Ordinance No. 1 on the minimum level of the technical and organisational measures and the permissible type of personal data protection [Recently, on the basis of the Personal Data Protection Act, the Personal Data Protection Commission adopted Ordinance No. 1, which imposes to set up a minimum level of technical and organizational measures in order to collect, store and process data.]
 
Law on Copyright and Neighboring Rights,  August 01, 1993 [English version]
 
[There is a contradiction between the applicable Rules of CIvil Procedure and the Law on Copyright and Neighboring Rights (LCNR), which requires a pending civil proceeding to be initiated before identification of infringers may be requested.  In contrast, rules of civil procedure do not allow a court to open the civil case without the identification of the defendant at least by name. This means that while Bulgarian law implements the right of information provided by Article 8(1) of the EU Enforcement Directive, its exercise is hindered by civil procedure rules.]
 
Criminal code (spec.  Art.172a-174, Article 159(1) and 159(3)), May 01, 1968  [English version]
 
[(1) Under the LCNR and the Criminal Code (CC), it is illegal to “upload (reproduction), distribute and make available (broadcast), transmits infringing content” on the Internet. Article 172а (1) of the Criminal Code states that “[e]very person who uploads (reproduces), distributes and makes available infringing content or transmits, or makes any other use of the object of a copyright or neighboring right without the consent of the rightholder as required by law, shall be punished by up to five years imprisonment and a fine up to BGN 5,000”. The LCNR in  § 2 (3-5)  defines the terms “upload (reproduction)”, “distribute” and “make available (broadcasting)”. Both the Internet providers hosting the infringing materials and the end users who upload (reproduce) may be held liable under this provision because the law does not make any difference on how the infringement is made and “every person” may be held liable under this provision. 
 
(2) Legal provisions for blocking access to child pornography exist. Whoever produces, exhibits, broadcasts, offers, sells, lends or in any other way circulates works of pornographic content involving a minor, underage person, or a person with such an appearance shall be imprisoned for up to five years.]
 

Law of Obligations and Contracts (spec. Art.45(1) ), January 1, 1951 [English version]
 
[Providing a general principle of civil liability according to which any person is liable for the damages it causes. Every person must redress the damage he has guiltily caused to another person. In all cases of tort, guilt is presumed until proven otherwise.]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Constitutional Court of Bulgaria, Case No 8/2014 г, March 12, 2015
 
[Bulgaria’s Constitutional Court ruled on March 12 to declare provisions in the Electronic Communications Act Art.250а-251а mandating the bulk collection of telecommunications data as unconstitutional. The unconstitutional provisions required telecommunication service providers to save all traffic data for a period of one year, which can be extended by a further six months at the request of law enforcement. Additionally, the provisions also breached the constitutional rights of privacy and the freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and all other communications. ]
 
Sofia Administrative Court, Decision № 5920/2012 (administrative trial case № 6859/2012), acting in Cassation, November 7, 2012
 
[(1) The Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) was claiming that an ISP hosting a website with false and misleading real estate advertisements was engaging in unfair commercial practice contrary to Article 68d of Consumer Protection Act (CPA).
 
(2) The court found that the investigation made by the administrative authority, the CPC, imposing penalties, was not sufficient to identify who committed the offence. It was not proven that the defendant should be regarded as an ISP at all. Some evidences may have led to the conclusion that the ISP was a hosting provider but it was never proved in the course of the investigation that he was acting in this capacity.
 
(3) The simple listing of company names with references to websites with the same names, was considered as insufficient by the court to prove in a definitive way the relation between the defendant and the offence of posting false advertisements under Article 68c and 68d (4) of the CPA.
 
(4) The Sofia City Administrative Court, before which the appeal was held, confirmed the first instance decision of the Sofia Regional Court, canceling the CPC's penalty and stating that the offence was not proven. (Please note that the Administrative Court in Bulgaria acts as an appellate court of last resort reviewing the administrative cases held before the Regional Courts in first instance.)]

 

Lower Courts


Sofia Regional Court, Decision № -/2013 (administrative trial case № 8308/2012), June 10, 2013
[spam, ISP, notion]
 

[(1) Plaintiff sent internet users unsolicited bulk e-mail, commonly known as ""spam,"" to promote its internet business and  website. The recipients of these unsollicited communications filled complaints with the Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) under Art.6 (3) Law on Electronic Commerce (LEC) against the website, without knowing the identity of the website owner.The CPC found that the domain eroticnetwork.bg is registered by a physical person who is also enlisted as an administrative and technical contact person.
 
(2) The plaintiff claimed that he is not to be considered as an ISP, because he is a physical person and is not registered as a commercial entity under the Commercial Act.
 
(3) The court considered Article 13 (1) of LEC stating that: “Upon providing access to or transmission trough electronic communication network the service provider shall not be liable for the content of the information transmitted and for the activities of the recipient of the service, if the provider: 1. does not initiate the transmission of the information; 2. does not select the receiver of the information transmitted, and 3. does not select or modify the transmitted information.” The court also considered Article 3(1) of LEC under which “Internet Service provider shall be any natural or legal person that provides services for the information society."" The act of registering a domain and giving access to it to users by providing them with username and password for the website, the Court stated, represented such a service. The court also found that the plaintiff is the registrant and administrator (the one providing passwords and access to users) to the domain in question - eroticnetwork.bg.
 
(4) Based upon this the court has found that the plaintiff should be considered  as an ISP, which violated the Art.6 (4) of LEC and Art.6 (3) of LEC for sending unsollicited communications.]
 

Administrative Enforcement

Competition Protection Commission, Net Info and others vs. Google Irland and Google Inc., No. 395 (May 12, 2015)
 
(1) The Bulgarian online media companies Net Info and V Box—Bulgaria's largest video sharing portal—filed a complaint with the Competition Protection Commission (CPC) against Google and its video portal YouTube. The plaintiff claimed that Google violated Articles 29 and 36, para.1 of the Law on Protection of Competition. Article 29 states that “Any action or omission when carrying out economic activity, which is contrary to good faith commercial practices and damages or may damage the interests of competitors shall be prohibited.” Article 36 (1) provides that “Carrying out unfair competition, aimed at soliciting clients, as a result of which existing agreements are terminated or breached, or entry into such agreements with competitors is prevented, shall be prohibited.”)

 
(2) The complaint was prompted by the fact that during the election campaign in Bulgaria in 2014, YouTube was showing ads for various Bulgarian political parties and candidates without complying with the provisions of Art. 138a of the Election Code, which obliges the providers of media services to announce on their web sites information about the contracts concluded with the parties, coalitions and nomination committees that have registered candidates and/or with another contracting authority in connection with the election campaign, if the contract has been concluded with an intermediary. They are also required to present to the Audit Office and the Central Electoral Commission clear advertising tariffs for the political parties during the campaigns. Google did not do so and thus the aims of the Election Code were diluted which led to alleged breach of the Art. 29 and art.36, para.1 of the Law on Protection of Competition.
 
(3) The plaintiff claims that “although the Election Code does not apply to the social networks, YouTube is not to be considered a social network.” Under § 20 of the Supplementary Provisions of the Election Code “Media service provider” shall be “a sole-trader natural person or a legal person who or which has editorial responsibility for the choice of the content of the media service and determines the manner in which the said service is organized.”
 
(4) The main argument of the plaintiff is that both the respondent and themselves are to be qualified as Media service providers ergo they should be both subject to the abovementioned obligations. The CPC issued Decision No 395-12/05/2015 in favor of the defendant. This decision is now appealed before the Supreme Administrative Court (last instance).

12,Slovenia,"Legislation | Bills and Pending Proposals | Decisions | Other Resources | Contributors | Feedback | Return to WILMAP Home Page
SUMMARY (provided by Damjan Bonač): (1) Intermediary liability of internet service providers is a relatively new issue in Slovenian case law and legal doctrine. Most cases refer to the infringements of personal rights through defamatory statements.

(2) In Slovenian law, the Electronic Commerce Market Act implements the safe harbor regime which was introduced by the eCommerce directive. However, there are no specific statutory provisions that are able to provide a special liability basis for intermediaries. Therefore, their liability must be determined according to general rules of tortious liability. Due to the fact that Slovenian law limits the establishment of liability for third parties to the existence of a specific relationship between that party and the primary infringer (e.g. parental liability or liability for employees) and that the establishment of strict liability must be explicitly provided by law, internet intermediaries will only be liable for their own conduct – action or omission (e.g. if they support or induce the infringement). Therefore culpability is a necessary prerequisite for the establishment of extra-contractual liability for online intermediaries.
 
(3) However, according to case law (see cases VSM I Cp 11/2015,  VSL I Cp 252/2014 and VSL I Cp 3037/2011 below), it is likely that internet intermediaries will be liable if they cannot establish a valid safe harbor defense. In other words, if an online intermediary acquires knowledge of an illegal activity and does nothing to prevent it, it will automatically become liable as its inaction will be interpreted as a dereliction of a duty of care (either intentionally or negligently). In this respect, the safe harbor provisions, which were intended to protect against liability, may be interpreted by Slovenian courts to add grounds for its establishment.
 
(4) Injunctions can be based on the Electronic Commerce Market Act as well as on some other statutes (e.g. article 134 of Code of Obligations for infringements of personal rights). In addition, according to case law, injunctions can also be based on a legal doctrine similar to the German principle of disturbance liability (Störerhaftung) (see case VSL I Cpg 862/2013 below).

LEGISLATION


Electronic Communications Act, December 20, 2012 [English Version]
 
[Article 203 of the Electronic Communications Act (Zakon o elektronskih komunikacijah, hereinafter ZEKom-1) obliges internet network operators and internet access providers to refrain from any interference that would limit, retain or slow down internet traffic in order to retain net neutrality, unless the court issues an injunction.]
 
Electronic Commerce Market Act, May 30, 2006 
 
[The eCommerce directive was implemented into Slovenian law by the Electronic Commerce Market Act (Zakon o elektronskem poslovanju na trgu, hereinafter ZEPT).
 
(1) The safe harbor regime (articles 12 to 15 of eCommerce directive) is transposed almost verbatim into the act , thus providing liability exemptions for mere conduit service providers (article 9), caching providers (article 10) and hosting providers (article 11). 
 
(2) ZEPT also provides that service providers cannot be obliged to monitor information transmitted or stored by them or to search for circumstances indicating an illegal activity (article 8(3)).
 
(3) The legal basis for injunctions is provided in article 9(3), 10(2), 11(2) and article 18 of ZEPT. It should be noted that the possibility to issue an injunction is explicitly limited to courts and cannot be administered by administrative bodies.
 
(4) As in the eCommerce directive, the requirement that the service must be normally provided for remuneration in order to qualify as an information society service and thus benefit from the safe harbour regime is also present in ZEPT. Furthermore, this requirement is particularly emphasized in the article 1(2) which states that ZEPT refers to the information society services that are provided as commercial activities.]
 

Code of Obligations, October 3, 2001 [English Version]
 
[The Code of Obligations (Obligacijski zakonik, hereinafter OZ) provides basic tort principles upon which internet intermediaries may be held liable.
 
(1) Article 131 thus stipulates that: “Any person that causes damage to another shall be obliged to reimburse it; unless it is proved that the damage was incurred without the culpability of the former”. Besides the possibility that internet intermediaries may be held liable as primary infringers, joint and several liability is imposed on all participants, instigators and those who assist the liable person in evading detection (article 186). Although culpability is necessary in order to find a person liable under this heading, negligence can also be sufficient when imposing liability on intermediaries.
 
(2) In connection to infringements of personal rights, Article 134 OZ provides the legal basis for injunctions requiring the defendant to terminate and refrain from infringements.]



BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Draft Law on Amending and Supplementing the Media Act, May 25, 2015
 
[(1) The Ministry of Culture released a new Draft Law on Amending and Supplementing the Media Act, which states that in order to regulate hate speech – especially on online media platforms – the ""editor-in-chief"" should be held liable for user-generated content (comments and other audiovisual material). Furthermore, the ""editor-in-chief"" must implement and publish rules for the selection and inclusion of comments. All comments that are not in line with such rules must be deleted in the shortest time possible. Failing to meet listed obligations constitutes a misdemeanor for which the ""editor-in-chief"" could be fined between 500 and 5000 euros.
 
(2) The Information Commissioner has already expressed concerns regarding the purposed amendments by stating that such obligations could seriously impede constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The Commissioner has also emphasized that such responsibility leads to general monitoring obligation which is explicitly prohibited by Slovenian (Article 8 of ZEPT) and European law (Article 15 of eCommerce directive).]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts
[There are no Supreme Court decisions to date.]
 

Lower Courts


Higher Court in Maribor, VSM sodba I Cp 11/2015, 2015
[defamation, discussion forum provider, third party comments, hosting provider liability]
 
[The Court upheld the decision of the court of first instance which imposed liability on the operator of a discussion forum for failing to remove defamatory statements, written by its users. The Court stated that the defendant was acting as a host provider under the meaning of article 11 of ZEPT (article 14 of eCommerce directive); therefore, he was obliged to immediately remove or disable access to the infringing statements, as soon as he was informed of their illegal nature. The court concluded that in failing to do so, the discussion forum operator was liable for the unlawful conduct of its users.]
 
Higher Court in Ljubljana, VSL sodba in sklep I Cp 252/2014, 2014
[defamation, personality rights, liability for damages, blog]
 
[(1) The Court confirmed the decision of the court of first instance which held that a blogger (a well know musician) and the blog portal operator (which was acting as a host provider) were not liable for the defamatory statements which were infringing on the plaintiffs personal rights since the plaintiff itself contributed to the damage by introducing the disputed facts from his personal life to the public (injured party`s consent).
 
(2) However, the court emphasized that hosting providers are obliged to expeditiously remove or block access to illegal information as soon as they are aware of its potentially unlawful nature and not only after they acquire knowledge of the illegality by injunction or judgement. The Court`s reasoning also suggests that defaulting the obligation to remove allegedly infringing content leads to the automatic establishment of joint and several liability with the primary infringer in case the disputed content is later determined to be illegal. In addition, the Court held that the assessment of the possibility for a blog portal operator to perform editorial control over the hosted content was irrelevant for the decision.]
 
Higher Court in Ljubljana, VSL sklep I Cpg 862/2013, 2013
[discussion forum provider, defamation, third party comments, hosting provider liability, injunction]
 
[(1) The Court upheld an interim injunction issued against an hosting provider running a web forum where the primary defendant posted the statements tarnishing the reputation of a legal entity.
 
(2) The court explicitly stated that liability is imposed not only on the immediate wrongdoer and any participants in the wrongdoing, but also on anyone who, in any way, knowingly and causally contributes to an infringement by another or creates a risk which could result in the breach of a protected legal right, provided that it is possible and reasonable for them to prevent the infringement. The Court held that the hosting provider should do everything that is technically possible to prevent infringement after being informed of the illegal content by the plaintiff. 
 
(3) Since the Court also made a reference to a legal publication describing the German approach to hosting providers liability in the Alone in the Dark case (BGH I ZR 18/11) and the German doctrine of disturbance liability (Störerhaftung), it seems this German doctrine was also introduced in Slovenian jurisprudence. However, the Court did not explain what is actually meant by “technically possible and reasonable measures” as well as failed to provide any conditions that would define reasonable duties to review.]
 
Higher Court in Ljubljana, VSL sodba I Cp 3037/2011, 2011
[defamation, liability for damages, blog, hosting, injunction]
 
[(1) The Court upheld a decision to impose joint and several liability on a blog portal operator, who was acting as a host provider, despite the fact that there was no editorial control over the blog posts and the identity of the primary defendant, a well known blogger, was well known.
 
(2) The court held that hosting providers are not liable for the information they transmit or store on the request of their users if they are not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegality is apparent or if they expeditiously remove or block access to such information once they are aware of their unlawful nature. If the provider does not act accordingly, they may be held liable for the information that they store on the request of their users.
 
(3) The Court concluded that the provider lost his safe harbor privileges at the moment when the plaintiff informed him about the defamatory statements posted on the primary defendant’s blog. Since the Court did not provide any other legal basis for liability, it seems that losing the safe harbor defense lead to the establishment of liability.]

LEGISLATION


[Intermediary liability of online service providers is specifically governed by the law on electronic messages, electronic signatures and electronic transactions. Other existing laws do not directly envisage liability of online intermediaries but provide criminal penalties for infringing intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright), violation of right to privacy, defamation etc.]

Greek Presidential Decree 131/2003, implementing Directive 2000/31/EC, May 16, 2003
 
[Articles 11-14 provide that the intermediary will not be held liable for the type of information transmitted through, cached in, or hosted on the intermediary’s services, as long as some prerequisites apply. More specifically, for the intermediary to not be held liable, the intermediary must not be the sender of nor be able to select the recipient of the transmitted information, must be unable to modify said information, must take action to remove or restrict cached or hosted information in a timely fashion, and must not be aware of the infringing nature of the information. The intermediary is not required to actively check the transmitted, cached or hosted information in order to determine potential infringement, but is required to report any infringements located, with respect to provisions regarding personal data confidentiality and protection.]

Lower Courts


Protodikeio Athinon [Athens Court of First Instance], Decision 13478/2014, December 22, 2014
[copyright, ISPs, p2p, illegal downloading, website blocking]
 
[(1) This recent high-profile case was a joinder of multiple applications for injunctions by Greek collecting societies against Greek ISPs in order to block access to websites containing potentially infringing content and enabling downloading of illegal files via p2p services.
 
(2) The court decided it would not allow the injunctions, determining that the intermediary Greek ISPs could not be ordered to block access to the above-mentioned websites.
 
(3) The court also highlighted the need for safeguarding users’ rights of participating in the information society and confidentiality of communications (as outlined in the Greek Constitution articles 5A, 9A, and 19.) and deeming that such a measure was against the principles of proportionality and net neutrality, as the websites and services in question can also be used for legitimate purposes.]
 
Plimmeleiodikeio Athinon [Athens Magistrates Court], Blogme.gr case, January 23, 2013
[defamation, blog aggregator, administrator, comments]
 
[(1) The court acquitted the administrator of a blog aggregator website, after a Greek TV personality sued him for defamation and indecency over comments posted about him on another blog, whose content the defendant’s website aggregated.
 
(2) Based on P.D. 131/2003 and Directive 2000/31/EC, as well as Greek legislation regarding the liability of news vendors, the court decided that the defendant was an intermediary and could not be held liable for the content of blogs aggregated on his website.]
 
Protodikeio Athinon [Athens Court of First Instance], Decision 4658/2012, May 16, 2012
[copyright, ISPs, p2p, linking, website blocking, temporary injunction]
 
[(1) The court ordered a temporary injunction against Greek ISPs in order to block access to certain websites that were thought to illegally contain or distribute copyrighted content on a large scale.
 
(2) The court took care to mention that forcing the ISPs to filter data in order to prevent copyright infringement, restricting communication technologies such as p2p file exchange methods, and blocking entire websites when only certain web pages contained infringing content was disproportionate and against the Greek Constitution and European law but decided to order the blocking of the websites in question on the more questionable grounds of equating hyper-linking towards copies of copyrighted works with hosting such copies (the blocked websites contained hyper-links towards files of copyrighted works hosted on known international file-sharing websites).]

LEGISLATION


Copyright Act, last amended by Act No. 12137, Dec. 30, 2013 (English Version)
 
[(1) Article 102 provides safe harbor for intermediaries from third party copyright infringement. The provision was amended twice in 2011 first to reflect the Korea-EU FTA and then the Korea-US FTA. EU Directive 2000/31/EC Section 4 “Liability of intermediary service providers” was almost exactly reproduced verbatim in the Intellectual Property chapter of the Korea-EU FTA, and the intellectual property chapter of the Korea-US FTA adopted the structure of DMCA safe harbor provisions. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the structure of Article 102 is very similar to that of EU Directive 2000/31/EC and DMCA. Paragraph (1) sets out specific conditions necessary for safe harbor for different types of Online Service Providers (OSPs). It classifies OSPs into four classes: mere conduits (subparagraph 1), caching (subparagraph 2), hosting (subparagraph 3), and information location tools (subparagraph 4). Paragraph (2) provides another safe harbor, stating that where it is technologically impossible for an OSP to take measures under paragraph (1), the OSP shall not be held liable. However, the court rarely, if ever, accepted a defense based on the provision. Paragraph (3) announces that OSPs do not have any general obligation to monitor. In spite of the provisions, there is much criticism on the court’s rigidness and lack of reasoning in application of safe harbors for intermediaries (see below). It seems the courts do not clearly discern elements of copyright infringement and conditions for enjoying safe harbors. That is, the courts tend to hold intermediaries liable if they do not meet the safe harbor >conditions instead of engaging in an independent analysis of liability.
 
(2) Article 103 sets out a notice and takedown system partially similar to DMCA. If a person claims copyright infringement and demands an OSP to suspend the reproduction or transmission of the works, the OSP should immediately comply and inform the claimant and the alleged infringer of such suspension. The reproducer or transmitter may request restoration by showing that acsuch reproduction or transmission was lawful. The OSP will be exempt from liabilities arising from the claimed copyright infringement by complying with the procedure in Article 103. Before the Copyright Act amendment in 2011, the OSP “may” be exempted or get its liability reduced. “Reproduction and transmission” is the term of art used by the legislators to describe the act of making material available online for downloading. The crucial difference with DMCA is that Korean copyright law requires on-demand takedown not as a requirement for qualifying for the safe harbor but as an unconditional requirement. The OSP cannot choose to deviate from the notice and takedown procedure.
 
(3) According to Article 103-3, a right holder may request an OSP for information necessary to take civil or criminal legal action against an alleged infringer such as the infringer’s name and address. When the OSP refuses, the person may request the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism to issue an order to the OSP. If the OSP does not comply with the Minister’s order to provide the information, the OSP will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 10 million won under Article 142(2)1. This was newly introduced to the Copyright Act in 2011.
 
(4) Article 104 is a unique provision to regulate special types of OSPs – mainly P2P and web-hard (cyber-lockers) service providers . It is unique and unprecedented in that it imposes direct obligation on the OSPs to implement the necessary measures for filtering out unlawful material. When there is a request by a right holder, those special types of OSPs must implement measures including filtering. The Enforcement Decree of the Copyright Act defines those necessary measures as: 
Technical measures capable of identifying the work, etc. by comparing the title, characteristics of work, etc. (basically, a filtering measure mainly based on the titles and hash values of the works)
Measures of limiting search or transmission to cut off illegal forwarding of work, etc. that came to be recognized pursuant to subparagraph 1 (basically, a keyword based measure that prevents searching of the keywords and uploading of files including the keywords);
Where the illegal forwarder of the relevant work, etc. is identifiable, the dispatch of warning sign wording to the forwarder of the work, etc. requesting for the prohibition of infringement on the copyright. 
Any OSP failing to implement such measures will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 30 million won under Article 142(1). Moreover, the OSP may be subject to cancellation or suspension of its business registration under the Telecommunications Business Act (see below). The court has been very strict in allowing the safe harbor of Article 102 to those special types of OSPs (see below). Constitutional complaint was raised, but the Constitutional Court found the provision constitutional (see below).
 
(5) In 2009, the Copyright Act introduced the notorious three-strike (or gradual response) regime. Article 133-2 and 133-3 prescribe a system where a subscriber, or an online bulletin board, which received more than three warnings is subject to suspension of its account up to six months. The suspension orders to OSPs are made by the Minister of Culture, Sports and tourism, which is an administrative agency. Those failing to abide by the provision – intermediaries - will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 10 million won under Article 142(2)4 and 5. This provision is on the brink of infringing on constitutional rights of the citizens as it may amount to an administrative censorship where no court review is involved.]
 
Telecommunications Business Act, last amended Act No. 12761, October 15, 2014 (English Version)
 
[(1) According to Article 27(2)6, a value-added telecommunications service provider of special type (the special types of OSPs such as P2P or web-hard service providers under Article 104 of the Copyright Act) which has been imposed the fine under Article 142(1) of the Copyright Act for more than three times may have its registration cancelled or its business suspended. “Value-added telecommunication service providers” is the term of art that describes all online hosts of applications and contents.
 
(2) The amendment by Act no. 12761 on 15 October 2014, which came into force on April 16, 2015, newly included Article 22-3 which compels those special types OSPs to adopt technical measures prescribed by Presidential Decree to prevent circulation of obscene materials. Those OSPs in violation of Article 22-3 will be punished by a civil fine not exceeding 20 million won under Article 104(3)1and its registration may be cancelled or its business suspended upon a request from the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) (Article 27(2)3-2). The Presidential Decree, the Enforcement Decree of the Telecommunications Business Act, was drafted by the KCC and came into force on the same day as the Act. As predicted, the Enforcement Decree lays out technical measures very similar to the corresponding provisions under the Presidential Decree of the Copyright Act, such as DB based filtering and keywords bans. The law basically treats obscene materials and copyrighted works the same. However, unlike copyrighted works, there is no clear standard on obscenity and there is yet no automatic, computerized process that perfectly filters obscene contents – that means the OSPs need to check all contents manually. The law imposes general monitoring obligation on those special types of OSPs which is technically impossible to abide by.]
 
Act on the Establishment and Operation of Korea Communications Commission (KCCA) last amended by Act No. 11711, March 23, 2013  (English Version)
 
[(1) Article 18 establishes the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC) consisting of nine members, in addition to the Korea Communications Commission KCC. 
 
(2) Under Article 21 subparagraph 3 and 4, KCSC shall deliberate on matters falling under Article 44-7 of ICNA (defamation, etc., see below), and also deliberate and issue correction requests on information prescribed by the Presidential Decree “as necessary for nurturing sound communications ethics.” The “sound communications ethics” language in Article 21 subparagraph 4 was challenged in the Constitutional Court for its vagueness, but the Court held it constitutional (24-1(A) KCCR 25, 2011Hun-Ga13, February 24, 2013), stating that its scope can be narrowed to the information to be restricted under Articles 44-2 and 44-7 of ICNA  . According to Article 8 of the Presidential Decree of KCCA, correction requests include deletion or blocking of information, suspension or cancellation of a user’s account, and other necessary measures such as labelling information as harmful to juveniles. If an intermediary does not follow KCSC’s correction request, KCSC may request KCC to order the intermediary to comply. The intermediary or the poster may file an objection to KCSC within 15 days from receiving the correction request. KCSC reviews the objection to its own request and its decision cannot be challenged.
 

(3) Article 24 requires KCSC to enact communications deliberation standards to deliberate on Article 21 subparagraph 3 and 4, and according to Article 25(1)2, when KCSC finds that the content of communication violates the standards, KCSC may determine what sanctions under Article 44-7 of ICNA to be imposed upon intermediaries. When KCSC makes the determination it must immediately request KCC to make an order upon it and KCC must follow the request.
 
(4) If an intermediary does not comply with KCC’s order, it will be punished under Article 73 subparagraph 5 of ICNA (see below). In practice, instead of going through all the due process necessary in issuing the sanctions under Article 21 subparagraph 3, KCSC exclusively uses correction requests under Article 21 subparagraph 4 which have been dutifully complied by the intermediaries although there’s no penal provision for not following KCSC’s correction requests. Objection to a correction request is very scarcely filed (less than 0.01%). With the infinitesimal objection rate, the total number of blocking or removal of information reached 104,400 in 2013.]
 
Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles Against Sexual Abuse, last amended by Act No. 11690, March 23, 2013 (English Version)
 
[(1) Article 2 subparagraph 1 defines “children or juveniles” as “persons under 19 years of age” and “child or juvenile pornography” as “depiction of children or juveniles, or persons or representations that can be perceived evidently as children or juveniles” doing sexual act. 
 
(2) Article 17 (Obligations of Online Service Providers) imposes obligations regarding child pornography on OSPs as follows:
Any online service provider who fails to take measures prescribed by Presidential Decree to detect child or juvenile pornography in the information and communications network managed by himself/herself or who fails to immediately delete the detected pornography and take technical measures to prevent or block transmission thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment with prison labor for not more than three years or by a fine not exceeding 20 million won: Provided, That this shall not apply where the online service provider has not been negligent in paying due attention to detect the child or juvenile pornography in the information and communications network or where substantial technical difficulty exists even though he/she has tried to prevent or block the transmission of the detected child or juvenile pornography.
Online service providers of special type under Article 104 of the Copyright Act shall indicate words of warning, as prescribed by Presidential Decree, on the relevant screen or transmission program, clearly stating that a person who produces, distributes or possesses any child or juvenile pornography may be subject to punishment where their users search, upload or download the works stored at their computers, etc. (OSPs in violation of Article 17(2) will be punished by a civil fine not exceeding 30 million won according to Article 67(1).)
 
(3) The Presidential Decree provides two measures to detect child pornography. One is a notification system by the users, and another one is a measure which can detect child pornography upon its technical features. The problem is that it is illegal to establish a child pornography database in Korea because Article 11(4) punishes possession of child pornography while the DB is required to extract the technical features. Also, people who either willfully or accidently downloaded child pornography are equally punished for possession in Korea.]
 
Act on the Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce, Etc., last amended by Act No. 11461, June 1, 2012 (English Version)
 
[(1) Article 2 subparagraph 4 defines “mail order brokerage” as “the act of intermediating mail order between both parties to a transaction by allowing the use of a cybermall (referring to a virtual shopping mall established to transact goods, etc. by using computers, etc. and information communications facilities), or by other methods prescribed by Ordinance of the Prime Minister.” For example, Korea’s largest online shopping mall Gmarket owned by eBay Korea is a mail order broker according to the definition above. 
 
(2) According to Article 20 and 20-2, mail order brokers should inform consumers that they are not a party to a mail order, or they will be jointly liable if the seller caused financial damages to customers. Moreover, the brokers should make information about the sellers available to the consumers, or they will be jointly liable if the information was not available or incorrect. 
 
(3) The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has the power to impose correction orders when the brokers are in violation of Article 20 and 20-2 under Article 32(1)1. FTC can also suspend the business (Article 32(4)) or impose penalties instead (Article 34).]
 
Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, etc. (ICNA, Information and Communications Network Act), last amended by Act No. 11322, February17, 2012 (English Version)
 
[(1) Article 44-2(1) and (2) provide that, when a person requests certain information to be deleted as it infringes upon the person’s rights, the service provider “shall” immediately delete, temporarily block up to 30 days (“temporary measure”), or take any other necessary measure on the information.  Always unsure of whether the information is rights-infringing or not, the provision has incentivized the service provider into erring on the side of deleting, often by deleting lawful information.
 
On top of that, Paragraph (4) states that “if a dispute resolution is anticipated or if the service provider is not sure of the rights-infringing nature of the information”, it “may” take a temporary measure instead of a permanent measure. According to a Constitutional Court in 2012 (2010Hun-ma88), the total effect of these provisions means that the takedown obligation arises not just when the information is infringing another’s rights but whenever a supposed victim requests takedown with certification to that effect.  In other words, when the unlawfulness of the information is in doubt as in Article 44-2(4), the service provider “may” take a less drastic, temporary measure but that is the minimum it must do whenever there is such request. Yet, the Constitutional Court found such provisions constitutional, citing the amplified danger of speech going online.  Moreover, there is no procedure to request restoration of deleted or blocked information available to the poster, unlike the U.S.’ DMCA or the current Copyright Act of the country.
 
(2) Article 44-5 is another safe harbor that exempts from identity theft liability those public institutions implementing real-name identification system for their online bulletin boards.
 
(3) According to Article 44-6, a person may file a claim with the defamation dispute conciliation division under Article 44-10 to require service providers to furnish information about the alleged offender if the conciliation division decides so after deliberation.
 
(4) Article 44-7 sets out the power of Korea Communications Commission (KCC) to order service providers to reject, suspend, or restrict processing of illegal information ranging from obscene or defamatory information to information aiming at, aiding, or abetting any crime. KCC should provide the intermediaries and users opportunities to submit opinions unless there are certain reasons not to do so. Article 73 subparagraph 5 states that a service provider failed to perform KCC’s order shall be punished by imprisonment not more than two years or a fine not exceeding 20 million won. Article 44-7 together with the penal provision gives KCC, an administrative agency, absolute power to censor almost any information on the Internet as the scope of illegal information is very broad.]
 
Public Official Election Act, last amended by Act No. 11071, November 7, 2011 (English Version)
 
[(1) Article 82-4 is titled “Election Campaigns by Utilizing Information and Communications Networks.” According to paragraph (3), when the election commission of each level or any candidate has found any information in violation of the Public Official Election Act on Internet, it may request intermediaries to reject, suspend, or restrict processing of the information. Intermediaries should promptly comply with the request, and the intermediaries or posters of the information may file objection to the election commission within three days from the receipt of the request.
 
(2) If an intermediary does not comply with the request once, it shall be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding three million won pursuant to Article 261(6)4. If it does not comply more than once, it shall be punished by imprisonment not more than two years or a fine not exceeding four million won pursuant to item (e) of Article 256(3)1.]

24-1(B) KCCR 578, 2010Hun-Ma88, May 31, 2012
[constitution, unlawful information, freedom of expression, takedown system]
 
[This is a decision on the notice and takedown system under Article 44-2 of ICNA (see above). The Constitutional Court found that the provisions do not infringe upon the freedom of expression under Article 21 of the Constitution because, although the provision, by requiring the service provider to take some actions on all takedown requests, has the danger of abating lawful information, the public interest in taking down unlawful information prevails.]
 
23-1(A) KCCR 53, 2009Hun-Ba13, 52, 110 (consolidated), February 24, 2011
[constitution, article 104, copyright act, special OSPs]
 
[Majority of the Constitutional Court found Article 104 of the Copyright Act constitutional. However, two Justices dissented, stating that it is unconstitutional to delegate the authority to determine the notion of special types of OSPs to the announcement of the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism.]

Supreme Court Decision 2011Do1435, September 26, 2013
[copyright, safe harbor, article 102 copyright act, criminal liability, technically impossible]
 
[(1) In this decision, the Supreme Court clarified that the safe harbor under Article 102 of the Copyright Act (before it was amended by Act no. 8852 on 29 February 2008) also applies to criminal liabilities.
 
(2) The Supreme Court further explained the meaning of being “technically impossible” under Article 102(2). In this case, the defendants implemented filtering measures utilizing hash values and banned keyword lists. The Supreme Court found that those measures were not state of the art measures available and didn’t even work properly, and therefore the defendants cannot resort to the safe harbor under Article 102(2).]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2010Ma817, December 4, 2012
 
[(1) This is an important decision regarding trade of counterfeit goods on online shopping malls, so called open-markets, where the service providers do not sell goods but intermediate between sellers and customers and receive commissions. The plaintiff was Adidas and the defendant was eBay Korea. Adidas filed an injunction against eBay for the sale of counterfeit goods on Gmarket and Auction, the largest and top grossing open-market in Korea. Adidas alleged that eBay has a duty under Article 44(2) of ICNA (note: This provision declaratively states the service provider’s duty to make efforts to reduce rights-violating material on its services, and is not to be confused with Article 44-2 that imposes on-demand takedown obligations.) to prevent circulation of counterfeits and demanded eBay to take several measures including authenticity check of goods and counterfeit monitoring and filtering system. Adidas also argued that the notice and take down system and other measures eBay already put in practice were not sufficient. The Supreme Court found in favor of the defendant and dismissed the claim..
 
(2) The Supreme Court held that “any information that infringes upon other’s rights through invasion of privacy, defamation, etc.” does not include information infringing upon other’s trademarks and therefore the provision cannot be construed to impose alleged duty on service providers.
 
(3) This decision is significant in that Article 44-2, the on-demand takedown provision, also applies only to “any information that infringes upon other’s rights through invasion of privacy, defamation, etc.”, and therefore this Supreme Court decision can be said to have narrowed the scope of Article 44-2 to defamation and invasion of privacy only.]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2009Da4343, March 11, 2010
[copyright, hosting provider, search engine, Yahoo, copyright infringement, aiding]
 
[(1) This decision applied the rule of 2008Da53812 (see below), the leading case on intermediary liability, on copyright infringement. The defendant was Yahoo Korea and the plaintiff sued Yahoo Korea for copyright infringement. The issue here was whether Yahoo Korea was liable for copyright infringing materials posted by subscribers on its website.  
 
(2) The Supreme Court held in favor of the defendant. According to the Supreme Court, OSPs cannot be held liable for merely allowing subscribers to post copyright infringing materials and enabling the materials to be searched on their portals. OSPs are only liable for aiding the infringement for not taking necessary measures under three conditions: (1) illegality of the copyright infringing material is clear; (2) the OSP either received a notice from the right holder or was clearly aware of the infringement; and (3) it is technically and financially possible to control the material.]
 
Supreme Court en banc Decision 2008Da53812, April 16, 2009 (English Version)
[defamation, hosting provider, web portal, user posts]
 
[(1) This is a much criticized Supreme Court decision on intermediary liability for defamatory content. There were two contradictory Supreme Court decisions (2001Da36801 and 2002Da72194, see below) prior to this en banc decision on the same issue.
 
(2) The Supreme Court held web portal sites Naver, Daum, SK Communications, and Yahoo Korea liable for the defamation of the plaintiff whom the user postings there accused of deserting a girlfriend upon the second pregnancy after he talked her into aborting the first where the girlfriend then committed a suicide. The court upheld judgments of 10 million won, 7 million won, 8 million won, and 5 million won, respectively, against these services.
 
(3) Specifically, the court held that, barring special circumstances, (a) the intermediary shall be liable for illegal contents to the same extent as a news agency and therefore shall be liable when (1) the illegality of the content is clear; (2) the provider was aware of the content; and (3) it is technically and financially possible to control the contents. (b) On top of the duty to take down such contents immediately, the intermediary has a duty to block similar postings later on. (c) The Court will find the provider’s requisite awareness under (2) above:
 
when the victim has requested specifically and individually for the takedown of the content;
when, even without such request, the provider was concretely aware of how and why the content was posted OR
when, even without request, it was apparently clear that the provider could have been aware of that content.
 
(4) The end result is that the intermediary will be absolutely liable for a posting later found to be “clearly” defamatory if “it was apparently clear that the provider could have been aware of that content” even if the victim did not notify the intermediary of the existence of the content. The Court decision may have been inspired by Article 44 of ICNA which was in force at the time the postings were up, but the fact is that, even without Article 44/44-2 in full motion, the Court was already ready to impose a publisher-like liability on the intermediary and a monitoring obligation.]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2005Do872, December 14, 2007
[copyright, hosting provider, p2p file sharing, linking, copyright infringement, aiding, civil liabilit, criminal liability]
 
[(1) This case is significant in that the Supreme Court found p2p file sharing software “Soribada” – Korean Napster - liable for copyright infringement by aiding its subscribers’ crime.
 
(2) Following its reasoning in 2005Da11626 (see below), the Supreme Court did not differentiate civil liability and criminal liability.
 
(3) The Supreme Court held that all direct and indirect acts that facilitate copyright infringement are considered aiding. Moreover, it is sufficent that the aider was reckless and it is not required that the aider was specifically conscious of the date or place of infringement, the object copied, or the identity of the principal.]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2005Da11626, January 25, 2007 (English Version)
[copyright, hosting provider, p2p file sharing, Soribada, aiding, abetting, civil liability, criminal liability]
 
[(1) This decision affirmed the decision of appellate court (2003Na21140) which held an intermediary – “Soribada” - liable for aiding copyright infringement for the first time. In Korea, aiding and abetting have different meanings in civil liability and criminal liability. Article 760 of the Civil Act on joint tort treats aider and abettor the same. On the contrary, punishment for aiding a crime and punishment for abetting a crime are different: the latter is punished the same with the principal (Article 31(1) of the Criminal Act), while the former gets its punishment reduced (Article 32 of the Criminal Act).
 
(2) The Court stated that acts assisting infringement of the right to reproduce refers to all direct and indirect acts that facilitate the violation of the right held by other parties, and it is possible to assist the infringement recklessly as well as negligently. ""Soribada"" is accountable for aiding and abetting since they had dolus eventualis of, or at least could have expected, the circumstances by which the service would enable users to violate copyright. Yet, they developed and distributed ""Soribada"" program free of charge, operated the server, provided users with connection information of other users, and facilitated the infringement by letting the users share and copy MPEG-1 Audio Layer-3 (MP3) files converted from music CDs by use of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) method.]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2003Do4128, April 28, 2006 (English Version)
[obsenity, hosting provider, web portal, aiding and abetting, duty of deletion]
 
[(1) This case concerns obscene materials. The defendants were employees of an Internet portal in charge of the portal’s “entertainment channel.” There were obscene cartoons on the cartoon section of the entertainment channel.
 
(2) The Supreme Court held the defendant liable for not deleting the cartoons and thus aiding the violation of Article 48-2 of the former Framework Act on Telecommunications (amended by Act No. 6360 on January 16, 2001) which punished distribution, sale, rental or exhibition of obscene materials on the Internet. The issue in this case was whether the defendants had a duty to delete the cartoons. The court affirmed that such duty existed and that the defendants aided the crime by nonfeasance.]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2002Da72194, June 27, 2003 [English Version]
[defamation, hosting provider, pre-takedown liability, actual knowledge]
 
[(1) The Court held that, an intermediary, even if it knew or had reason to know of the defamatory material for 52 days, should not be held responsible unless a comprehensive analysis of the following factors point to such responsibility:  (i) the posting’s purpose, content, duration and method, (ii) the damages it has caused, (iii) the relationship between the speaker and the injury-claimant, (iv) the claimant’s attitude including whether rebuttal or takedown was requested, (v) the size and nature of the site posted, (vi) the degree of for-profit nature of the site, (vii) when the operator knew or could have known the posting’s content, and (viii) the technological and pecuniary difficulty in taking down, etc. Having said so, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court that imposed the liability for pre-takedown exposure.  
 
(2) The Supreme Court’s rather terse ruling sounds very generous, refusing to impose liability even upon knowledge of some indiscretion, especially when it was before the exemption provision was added to Article 44-2.  However, the ruling stands on the narrow fact that the intermediary here did comply immediately with the takedown request.]
 
Supreme Court Decision 2001Da36801, September 7, 2001
[defamation, hosting provider, bulletin board, takedown]
 
[The Supreme Court held an electronic bulletin board provider liable for refusing, even upon demands both by the injury claimant and a government censorship body, to takedown postings deprecating a pop singer’s fan for 5-6 months, stating the intermediary had “a duty to take adequate measures when it knew or had reason to know of a defamatory posting.”]



 

Lower Courts


Seoul High Court Decision 2010Na35260, October 13, 2010
 
[(1) In February 2009, Woo Jong-Hyun (surname Woo) recorded his 5-year old daughter casually singing part of the popular singer Sondambi’s major hit I am Crazy unaccompanied and imitating the singer’s gestures and posted the video clip on his blog opened at the country’s major portal Naver, operated by NHN. June of that year, the Korean Music Copyright Association (KOMCA) issued about 16,000 takedown notices to Naver, including the one on Woo’s video clip. Naver immediately took down the video clip and rejected Woo’s restoration notice and the video clip has been down ever since.
 
(2) Woo filed suit against KOMCA and NHN for damages under Article 103(6) of the Copyright Act: (6)  Any person who demands, without legitimate authority, the suspension or resumption of the reproduction or transmission of relevant works, etc. under paragraphs (1) and (3), shall make a compensation for any losses incurred thereby.
 
(3) Korean high court affirmed a lower court ruling that the 53 seconds long video clip constitutes a fair use, and ordered KOMCA to pay the plaintiff damages for unjustly requesting a takedown under the notice-and-takedown system. The judgment was not appealed and have now become final.]

LEGISLATION


Decree 36880-COMEX-JP, Regualtion for the Limitation of Liability of Service Providers for Copyright Infringement According to Article 15.11.27 of the FTA between República Dominicana Centroamérica and U.S.A., December 16, 2011 
 
[(1) In Costa Rica, intermediary liability was regulated in 2011. Despite receiving some critiques for being passed by a presidential decree and not by a law, the ISP liability mechanism is regarded as a balanced procedure overall by Internet users and experts.
 
(2) Costa Rica established judicial intervention prior to taking down content, or ordering ISPs to reveal information about specific users.
 
(3) This regulation has been rejected by the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) for its “overly long time periods” of up to 45 days by which ISPs are to forward notifications sent by rights holders, which “in practical terms create a serious obstacle for the enforcement of rights in the digital environment.” See Costa Rica International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) 2013 Special 301 Report on Copyright Protection and Enforcement, p. 53. Nevertheless, the normative has been generally in agreement with local stakeholders.]

LEGISLATION


Act 1068/2006, on the Measures Preventing the Propagation of Child pornography, December 2006 
 
[The law explicitly allows the police to maintain, and access providers to use for blocking, a secret list of websites, some 4000 entries, which may include child pornography. However, almost all providers have ceased using the list. A Supreme Administrative Court case, KHO 2013:136, held that a site providing links of blocked targets was helping in propagating child pornography and there were grounds to add it to the blocking list (see below).]
 
Act 460/2003, on the Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media, June 13, 2003 [English version]
 
[The law includes additional provisions on freedom of expression. Most importantly, hosting providers have no ""editor"" responsibility. In this regard, Sections 17–20 and 22 apply to technical operations ""consisting solely of the technical production, transmission, intermediation or distribution of publications or network messages"" (Section 3). Those provisions include a possibility for the court to order the disclosure of information to identify the message in a network if its publication is a criminal offence (Section 17) or to cease the distribution of a message with similar characteristics (Section 18).]
 
Act 458/2002, on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce,  June 5, 2002 [English version]
 
[The law implements the E-Commerce Directive almost verbatim, Sections 13–15 corresponding to Articles 12–14 of the Directive.
 
(1) A presumption of knowledge is provided by the hosting exemption in Section 15 for certain extreme pornography or incitement to hatred, which are assumed to be known also without a notification.
 
(3) Section 16 allows a court to issue an order to disable access to information, but only applies to hosting providers. The general obligation by the service provider to take action to implement a decision by the authorities is provided in Section 19, which implements Articles 12(3), 13(3) and 14(3) of the Directive. 
 
(4) There is no specific provision corresponding to Article 15 of the Directive, regarding the prohibition of monitoring obligations, nor a provision on the obligation to notify the authorities if the service provider notices illegal behavior.
 
(5) Sections 20–25 implement a rather detailed, DMCA-like notice-and-takedown mechanism that only applies to the hosting providers.]
 
Copyright Act 404/1961, July 8, 1961 [English version]
 
[Section 60a empowers a court to order an intermediary of those users to disclose information of subscribers who make copyrighted content available to the public ""to a significant extent"". Section 60b governs a suit to forbid continuing the infringement. Section 60c provides a possibility for an ""injunction to discontinue"" for intermediaries, essentially providing for website blocking or user disconnection orders. In case of a preliminary injunction, the claimant is required to sue the infringer as per Section 60b. Section 60c implements Article 8(3) of Infosoc Directive (2001/29/EC) and Article 9 of Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC).]
 
Code of Judicial Procedure 4/1734 [English version]
 
[Chapter 7 and in particular its Section 3 provides a general provision on judicial precautionary (preliminary) measures. However, it has been held that these injunctions cannot be applied against intermediaries (eg. in the context of copyright infringement), because they are not infringers and there is no liability, negligence, or such on part of the intermediary.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Copyright Act Amendment, HE 181/2014, submitted on October 9, 2014
 
[The upcoming bill would inter alia rephrase Section 60c on blocking injunctions, reportedly making it clearer and removing the requirement to sue the infringer in case of anonymity.]
 
Information Society Code, submitted on January 30, 2013 [English version]
 
[The bill, approved with changes on October 7, 2014, combines most telecoms regulations in a consolidated code. It will also move the E-Commerce liability provisions there without changes. The data retention legislation was maintained in place with some minor amendments. Intermediaries will need to comply with certain data protection requirements. Finally, no significant changes to the core intermediary liability provisions were included.]

[The operators and administrators of Bittorrent tracker ""Finreactor"" were held to be jointly criminally liable for users' copyright infringement and, in consequence, also liable for compensation and remuneration. The hosting exemption was not applicable due to the awareness, knowledge and participation of Finreactor to the infringing activities. The case has been reported in English for example in Pessi Honkasalo, Criminal Proceedings Against the Administrators of a BitTorrent Tracker: Finreactor KKO 2010:47, 32 EIPR 591 (2010). ]There have been also a number of appellate court decisions where the operators of DirectConnect hubs were similarly held to be responsible and liable for compensation (see below).]

[These cases concerned blocking access to The Pirate Bay. Requests were granted, but the court approved the list of blocked IP addresses and DNS names. Court approval is required for any changes to this list. [The cases have been reported in English (along with other cases) in Pekka Savola, Proportionality of Website Blocking: Internet Connectivity Providers as Copyright Enforcers, 5 JIPITEC 116 (forthcoming 2/2014). District Court decision is also discussed in Marcus Norrgård, Blocking Web Sites – Experiences from Finland in Johan Axhamn (ed.), Copyright in a Borderless Online Environment (Norstedts Juridik 2012). For more extensive discussion in Finnish, see eg. Pekka Savola, Internet-operaattoreihin kohdistetut tekijänoikeudelliset estomääräykset erityisesti vertaisverkkopalvelun osalta’ (Licentiate of Science (Technology) thesis, Aalto University 2013) and Taina Pihlajarinne, Internetvälittäjä ja tekijänoikeuden loukkaus (Lakimiesliiton Kustannus 2012).]
 
Court of Appeal of Eastern Finland, Decision S 12/306, October 4, 2012 
[copyright, infringement, internet access subscribers, open WLAN]
 
[The Court held that, in case of infringiment committed through an open WLAN network, it was more likely that the infringment, which was carried out by making works available to the public with DirectConnect, was committed by the the Internet access subscriber, rather than by some unknown user through the open WLAN network.]
 
Court of Appeal of Helsinki, ""pelastakaa pedofiilit"" decision, R 07/3400, May 29, 2008 
[hosting provider, DNS provider, blocking order]
 
[The E-Commerce Act, Section 16 was applied to issue against a hosting provider an order to remove access to the website. However, probably due to a technical misunderstanding, the order was issued to a DNS provider. However, it is arguable whether a DNS provider is to be considered a hosting provider and could be ordered to remove infringing content from a domain name.]
 
Court of Appeal of Helsinki, Decision S 05/445, June 2, 2005

[In this case, Section 18 of the Freedom of Expression Act (460/2003) was argued to be the basis for access providers to block access to a website allegedly distributing Finnish copyrighted films. The applicant was the police. The district court rejected the request on five different grounds, including that (1) the access provider is not an intermediary referred to in Section 18, (2) the measures are ineffective and (3) the request was not specific enough.]
 
District Court of Ylivieska-Raahe, Decision in case L 11/3769, May 14, 2012
[copyright, infringement, internet subscribers, open WLAN, liability, unknown user]
 
[The Court held that the provider of an open WLAN network was not shown to infringe and had no duty to protect the WLAN from outsiders. Therefore, the internet subscriber was not liable for infringement by some unknown user using the WLAN network. The fact that, at the same time the infringing activitiy took place, there was a public theater presentation in the internet subscriber's backyard may have been a factor taken into consideration by the court to conclude that someone else may have been the infringer.]

LEGISLATION


European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012, S.I. No. 59 of 2012 
 
[These Regulations amend sections 40 and 205 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 to allow an application for an injunction against an intermediary regarding copyright infringement.  They were enacted as a result of the Information Society Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC) and EMI v UPC (2010) (see below).] 
 
Defamation Act 2009
 
[The legislation governing defamation in Ireland. Includes a defence of innocent publication in s.27. A court may make an order prohibiting publication of a defamatory statement under s.33.  The Act also contains an offence of blasphemy in s.36.]
 
European Communities (Directive 2000/31/EC) Regulations 2003, S.I. No. 68 of 2003  
 
[This Statutory Instrument implements the E-Commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EC) into Irish law.  The Regulations include restrictions on liability, subject to certain conditions, regarding mere conduits, caching and hosting (Regs. 15-18).  Non-liability is defined to include civil or criminal liability (Reg. 15(b)). The Regulations do not apply to gambling activities (Reg.2).]
 
Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000
 
[The main Act dealing with Copyright in Ireland.  The Act has been amended a number of times and most of the amendments are available here. Of particular relevance to intermediaries, section 40(3) of the Act states that  the provision of facilities for enabling the making available to the public of copies of a work shall not of itself constitute an act of making available to the public of copies of the work.  S.40(4) states that where a person who provides facilities referred to in s.40(3) is notified by the owner of the copyright that those facilities are being used to infringe the copyright and the person fails to remove the infringing material as soon as practicable thereafter that person shall also be liable for the infringement. An additional subsection was added to s. 40 in 2012 – see European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 above.]

Self-Regulation

Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, Code of Practice and Ethics, 2002
 
[The Code governs the conduct of ISPAI's Members and may be amended from time to time by 75% majority vote of members of ISPAI. The Code mandates the development of acceptable use policies for participating ISPs which clearly set out guidelines for customers/users, including prohibitions on customers using ISP service to create, host, transmit material which is unlawful / libellous / abusive / offensive / vulgar / obscene / calculated to cause unreasonable offence. The Code also sets out procedures for dealing with complaints regarding third party content, illegal material and harmful material.]


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Copyright Review Committee, Modernising Copyright, 2013 
 
[A report by an expert committee on reform of copyright law, including a draft Bill. Includes proposals concerning intermediaries, e.g.  (1) that a “marshalling” exception be introduced for sites which index, syndicate, aggregate or curate online content and (2) that certain sections of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 concerning transient and incidental copies be amended to come more closely into line with the CJEU’s approach to interpretation of the Information Society Directive.] 
 
Privacy Bill, 2006 
 
[The Privacy Bill was published by the previous Government in 2006 but has not been enacted.  In 2012, the Minister for Justice stated that he was considering re-introducing a version of this Bill.]  

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Supreme Court, EMI v Data Protection Commissioner [2013] IESC 34 
[copyright, privacy, data protection, graduated response]
 
[A settlement had been reached between record companies and a large ISP, Eircom, instituting a Graduated Response Protocol under which Eircom would issue copyright infringement notices to customers.  The Data Protection Commissioner believed that this Protocol breached EU and Irish data protection law and issued an enforcement notice requiring Eircom to cease its operation of the Protocol. The Supreme Court found that the enforcement notice was invalid because of the absence of reasons.]
 


Lower Courts


High Court, Sony Music & Ors v UPC Communications [2015] IECH 317
[copyright, privacy, access provider, piracy, peer2peer, graduated response, identity disclousure]
 
[(1) The plaintiffs, Sony, Universal and Warner Music, sought an injunction to impose upon UPC Communications, the second largest Irish Internet access provider, an obligation to implement a ""Graduated Response Strategy"" (GRS) against UPC's subscribers allegedly infringing plaintiffs' copyrights online. The injunction sought was pursuant to s.40 (5A) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 (as amended) (see above) requiring that the defendant take reasonable steps to prevent its subscribers from using the defendant’s internet service for the purpose of breaching the plaintiffs’ copyright in the plaintiffs’ sound recordings
 
(2) According to the court, the essential elements of a GRS are that ""(i) the owners of the copyright send to the ISP a list of infringements with reference to specific internet protocol addresses; (The copyright owners can only identify the specific IP address. They cannot identify the name and address of the subscriber). However when this information is sent to the defendant, the defendant as the ISP can, using the IP addresses, identify the name and address of its subscribers. (ii) It then writes to its subscribers informing them that these matters have come to its attention. (iii) The second letter is a second reminder or threat of further action. (iv) The third step would be the suspension of the account for a week. (v) The fourth step would be the termination of the account.""
 
(3) The Court granted an injunction as sought by the plaintiff imposing upon UPC an obligation to implement a GRS as the European ""directives permit the courts of Member States to impose injunctions on internet service providers [, . . . ] even though ISPs are not regarded as liable in law for the actions of their subscribers,"" due the availability of a ""mere conduit"" defense. According to the injuction, the GRS cannot encompass any suspension or termination of users' accounts but only the disclosure of information to make a Norwich Pharmacal order to finally seek an accounts' suspension or termination. The GRS should encompass the following steps:
Step 1 - That the plaintiffs would furnish all relevant infringement information to the defendant and that the plaintiffs would bear the cost of this process.
Step 2 - That the defendant, when it receives a first copyright infringement notification from the plaintiffs, would send its subscribers a letter setting out the infringement and requesting him/her to cease and desist.
Step 3 - That the defendant where it receives a second copyright infringement notification would send a second letter to its subscriber requesting him/her to cease and desist.
Step 4 - That the defendant, where it receives a third copyright infringement in respect of a subscriber from the plaintiffs, would send to the plaintiffs a notification that a subscriber account has been the subject matter of three such notifications.
Step 5 - The plaintiffs, having been informed of a third copyright infringement notification and having been informed of the relevant IP addresses etc, could make a Norwich Pharmacal type application to ascertain the subscriber’s identity and address and the plaintiffs could then seek an order under s.40 (5A) for the suspension and/or termination of the subscriber’s service. Such applications would not be opposed or consented to by the defendant and the defendant would not seek its costs.
(4) Finally, the Court noted, on the issue of allocation of costs, that ""because the defendant is the company which profits - albeit indirectly - because it derives revenue from its subscribers who are engaged in this practice, it is the defendant who should, in my view, be primarily liable for the costs."" Therefore, according to the Court, UPC will be required to bear 80% of the costs estimated between €800,000 and €940,000. However, the plaintiffs may only send to UPC up to 2,500 infringment notifications per month.]
 
High Court, Walsh v Twitter, October 2, 2015
[privacy, data protection, defamation, hosting provider, Facebook, user information, disclosure]
 
[(1) Twitter International Company was ordered to disclose data about the source of tweets about a whistleblower. The tweets, which included allegations of insurance fraud, are alleged to be defamatory. The whistleblower has brought a defamation action against the poster of the tweets, and asked the court to require Twitter to turn over information that would allow the whistleblower to identify the poster.
 
(2) The Court order Twitter to turn over the poster’s name. The Court also issued an injunction to prohibit the destruction of any evidence or records related to the tweets.]
 
High Court, Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner [2014] IEHC 310 
[privacy, data protection, Facebook, transfers of personal data to USA]
 
[(1) The Data Protection Act 1988 as amended prohibits transfers of personal data outside the state unless adequate privacy protections are in place.  In 2000, the European Commission had decided that the USA ensured an adequate level of privacy protection for data.  A Safe Harbour framework had been put in place between Europe and the USA regarding transfers of personal data.
 
(2) In light of the Snowden revelations, Mr Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who runs the “Europe v Facebook” group, made a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner arguing that the Commissioner should direct that transfers of personal data from Facebook Ireland to Facebook in the USA should cease.  Facebook Ireland is responsible for millions of Facebook users outside the USA and Canada.
 
(3) The Commissioner decided that the request was unsustainable in law.  Mr Schrems sought Judicial Review of the Commissioner’s decision.  
 
(4) In the High Court, Hogan J. said that much had changed since 2000, including for example the entry into force of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  As a result, he referred questions of EU law to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU).  He also noted that mass and indiscriminate surveillance of communications as shown by the Snowden revelations would, as a matter of Irish law, be unconstitutional, but that Irish law on this matter had effectively been pre-empted by EU law.]  
 
High Court, Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner (No.2) [2014] IEHC 351
[privacy, data protection, Facebook, transfers of personal data to USA, amicus curiae]
 
[The High Court ordered that Digital Rights Ireland (DRI) be added as amicus curiae in the proceedings, which will now proceed to the CJEU.  DRI had stated that it would not adopt a position of partisanship. Hogan J. distinguished this case from the case of EMI v UPC [2013] IEHC 204, where DRI was not added as amicus curiae. The court also noted DRI’s successful case before the CJEU – Case 293-12, Digital Rights Ireland v Minister for Communications ECLI:EU:C:2014:238. The court did not permit DRI as amicus to alter the nature of the questions which it had already proposed should be transmitted to the CJEU.] 
 
High Court, Cummins v Twitter, February 2014 
[defamation, libel, hosting provider, Twitter]
 
[The High Court ordered that Twitter remove defamatory posts concerning the mayor of Waterford.  The order was made under s.33 of the Defamation Act 2009.]  
 
High Court, EMI v UPC [2013] IEHC 274
[copyright, access provider, ISP, torrent, ThePirateBay, blocking order]
[Record companies successfully applied for an order against various ISPs blocking access to the Pirate Bay website, based on the amended s.40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. Later in 2013, the record companies successfully applied to the High Court for Kickass Torrents to be blocked.]
 
High Court, EMI v UPC [2013] IEHC 204
[copyright, access provider, ISP, torrent, ThePirateBay, blocking order, amicus curiae]
 
[Record companies had instituted proceedings seeking an order against various ISPs blocking access to the Pirate Bay website.  Digital Rights Ireland (DRI) applied to be added as an amicus curiae.  The Court refused to add DRI to the case.  Considering Irish cases on criteria for joining an amicus curiae, the court found that this case did not involve novel principles and DRI was not a neutral party.]  
 
High Court, Tansey v Gill [2012] IEHC 42
[defamation, hosting provider, preliminary injunction, interlocutory order]
 
[The plaintiff claimed he had been defamed on the website www.rate-your-solicitor.com.  He successfully sought interlocutory orders under s.33 of the Defamation Act 2009 against certain defendants prohibiting publication of the defamatory statements.  The court noted that, since the arrival of the internet, judicial hesitation in granting interlocutory orders of this type should be eased. One of the defendants was the host of the website, Dotster, located in the USA.  Dotster had not made an appearance in the case and the court made a final order in default of appearance.]   
 
High Court, McKeogh v Doe [2012] IEHC 95 
[defamation, privacy, right to good name, video removal, Norwich Pharmacal orders.]
 
[The plaintiff had wrongly been identified as the taxi fare evader shown in a video posted on various websites.  The judgment primarily concerns the issue of whether the plaintiff could be named on newspaper websites reporting the court case and the court ordered that he could be named.  The court noted that it had earlier granted interim orders that social media sites such as YouTube and Google should remove the video and provide the identities of web users who had defamed the plaintiff.  The orders regarding identities of web users were granted applying the UK tort case of Norwich Pharmacal v Customs & Excise [1973] UKHL 6. According to media reports, there have been further developments in this case in 2013 and 2014.] 
 
High Court, EMI v UPC [2010] IEHC 377 
[copyright, access provider, mere conduit, ThePirateBay, E-Commerce Directive]
 
[Record companies sought orders (1) restraining UPC, an ISP, from making available to the public copies of sound recordings which breach copyright and (2) requiring UPC to block access to the Pirate Bay site. The court found that s.40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 only covered “removal” of infringing material and therefore an injunction could not be granted.  Charleton J. also reconsidered his previous decision in EMI v Eircom [2009] IEHC 411 (see below), in which he granted an order requiring an ISP to block access to the Pirate Bay, and stated that his previous decision in that case had been incorrect. Following this case, s.40 of the 2000 Act was amended by Statutory Instrument in 2012 (see above).] 
 
High Court, Digital Rights Ireland v Minister for Communications [2010] IEHC 22
[privacy, data protection, data retention, access providers, ISP, telephony providers, Directive 2006/24/EC, referral, ECJ, invalidity]

 
[This litigation concerned the validity of the data retention requirements imposed on ISPs and telephony providers. This case led to a decision by the CJEU (Grand Chamber) that the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC) was invalid, Case 293-12, Digital Rights Ireland v Minister for Communications ECLI:EU:C:2014:238.]
 

High Court, EMI v Eircom [2010] IEHC 108  
[copyright, data protection, graduated response]
 
[Record companies had reached a settlement with a large ISP (Eircom) instituting a graduated response system.  Charleton J. held that the settlement did not breach data protection laws as IP addresses in the hands of the record companies which do not identify subscribers are not “personal data”. He said that copyright is flagrantly violated by music theft and the sanction of terminating access is not excessive. Eircom’s terms and conditions stated that copyright must not be infringed and subscribers have agreed to these terms.]
 
High Court:  Irish Red Cross v UPC and Google (Unreported, 2010) [see news coverage here and here]
[confidentiality, breach, privacy, disclosure, alleged infringer, hosting provider, blog, liability of blog host]
 
[According to website reports, it appears that the High Court ordered that UPC and Google reveal the name of an anonymous blogger who allegedly breached confidentiality on the Blogger website.  Originally Google Ireland was named as defendant but the court permitted Google Inc to be substituted.] 
 
High Court, EMI v Eircom [2009] IEHC 411
[copyright, access provider, ISP, torrent, ThePirateBay, website blocking order, graduated response]
 
[Record companies had reached a settlement with a large ISP (Eircom) instituting a graduated response system. The court ordered, on application by the record companies, that Eircom should block access to the Pirate Bay website. The court based its decision on s.40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the Information Society Directive 2001.]  
 
High Court, Mulvaney v Sporting Exchange trading as Betfair [2009] IEHC 133 
[defamation, libel, hosting provider, gambling, chatroom, forum, E-Commerce Directive, hosting defence]
 
[Betfair was a gambling site which also operated internet forums (chatrooms) where users could discuss sports events and other issues. The plaintiffs alleged defamation by forum users. As a preliminary issue, Betfair successfully relied on the hosting defence in the E-Commerce Directive as implemented by the 2003 Regulations. The court found that the gambling exception to the Directive and Regulations did not apply as the forums were not directly connected to the gambling part of the site.] 
 
High Court, Ryanair v Johnston, 2005/514P, July 12, 2006 
[bullying, intimidation, privacy, hosting provider, bulletin board, website operator, moderator, members, liability, disclosure, identities, alleged infringers, Norwich Pharmacal order]
 
[This was an action against the operators and moderator of an internet site and bulletin board set up to facilitate discussions by Ryanair pilots.  Ryanair alleged that bullying and intimidation of pilots was taking place on the site and sought ‘Norwich Pharmacal’ orders to disclose the identities of certain users of the bulletin board. On reviewing the evidence, Smyth J. found that there was no evidence of bullying or intimidation or that Ryanair had suffered loss. He distinguished this case from EMI v Eircom, 2005 (see below) and the English case of Totalise v Motley Fool [2001] EWCA Civ 1897.  He also stated that a balance needed to be struck between justice and privacy.]   
 
High Court, EMI v Eircom [2005] IEHC 233 
[copyright, privacy, confidentiality, access provider, disclosure, identities, alleged infringers, Norwich Pharmacal order]
 
[Record companies requested Eircom, a large ISP, to provide identities of 17 customers who were allegedly infringing copyright. The High Court ordered that customers’ identities should be passed to the ISP, based on the UK tort case of Norwich Pharmacal v Customs & Excise [1973] UKHL 6. The court also relied on the Canadian case of BMG Canada v Doe 2004 FC 488.]

Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio Televisión y Medios Electrónicos [ResorteME] [Law of Social Responsability in RadioTelevision and Electronic Media], Official Gazzette No. 39.579, December 22, 2012
 
[In December 2010, the National Assembly of Venezuela adopted a reform of the Law of Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, extending regulation to online and electronic media.
 
(1) Under the amended law, websites may be fined for content posted by a third party and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who do not respond to government inquiries risk high fines and temporary suspension of operations (Articles 27 and 28).
 
(2) This law empowers the regulatory entity ""Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones de Venezuela (Conatel) [Venezuelan National Commission of Telecommunications]"" to open ""administrative procedures"" against ISPs. Administrative procedures do not involve lawsuits and judicial review, those are instructions given by Conatel that ISPs must comply under severe penalties imposed by the ResorteMe law.]
 

Administrative Regulations

Regulatory Entity: Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones de Venezuela (Conatel) [Venezuelan National Commission of Telecommunications]
 
[Under ResorteMe, the regulatory entity Conatel is entitled to open ""administrative procedures"" against ISPs. Administrative procedures do not involve lawsuits and judicial review, those are instructions given by Conatel that ISPs must comply under severe penalties imposed by the ResorteMe law.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

[There are currently no known new legislative proposals on the issue of intermediary liability.] 
DECISIONS



[There are currently no known cases that have been brought before the courts on the issue of intermediary liability. However, with ResorteME as the legal basis, the regulatory entity Conatel opened ""administrative procedures"" against ISPs (see below). Administrative procedures do not involve lawsuits, those are instructions given by Conatel that ISPs must comply under severe penalties imposed by the ResorteMe law.
 


Administrative procedures


Conatel, Administrative Procedure, October 10, 2014

 
[The National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) ordered the blocking of Infobae website which operates in Argentina, arguing the dissemination of images of deputy Robert Serra who was murdered on October the 1st. The information was released through Conatel president, William Castillo: ""Following instructions, due to serious violations of the laws of Venezuela, Conatel has ordered the blocking of the Infobae portal"". The official did not specify what law and/or articles were violated nor if any legal proceedings would follow, but since his statement the site is inaccessible from Venezuela.]

 
Conatel, Administrative Procedure, March 2014
 
[In March 2014, Conatel demanded that the ISPs block websites that illegally trade wildlife, basing this demand on a decision made by a court in Caracas. In spite of the queries made by some organizations and individuals, obtaining reliable information about this procedure has been not possible. The affected ISPs did not make any public statements.]
 
Conatel, Administrative Procedure, November 2013 
 
[Conatel opened administrative procedures against 8 ISPs. Those ISPs hosted information portals where the cost of the black market dollar was published (Venezuela has a foreign currency exchange control policy and this is forbidden by a special law). In spite of the queries made by some organizations and individuals, obtaining reliable information about this procedure has been not possible. The affected ISPs did not make any public statements.]

LEGISLATION


The Evidence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act of 2012, Act A1432
 
[The Amendment of Evidence Act 1950 introduced Section 114A. Presumption of fact in publication, providing
 
(1) A person whose name, photograph or pseudonym appears on any publication depicting himself as the owner, host, administrator, editor or sub-editor, or who in any manner facilitates to publish or re-publish the publication is presumed to have published or re-published the contents of the publication unless the contrary is proved. 
 
(2) A person who is registered with a network service provider as a subscriber of a network service on which any publication originates from is presumed to be the person who published or re-published the publication unless the contrary is proved. 
 
(3) Any person who has in his custody or control any computer on which any publication originates from is presumed to have published or re-published the content of the publication unless the contrary is proved. 
 
(4) For the purpose of this section - (a) “network service” and “network service provider” have the meaning assigned to them in section 6 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 [Act 588]; and (b) “publication” means a statement or a representation, whether in written, printed, pictorial, film, graphical, acoustic or other form displayed on the screen of a computer.]
 

[(1) Section 114A is controversial since it might enable law enforcement officials to hold publishers of websites accountable for seditious, defamatory, or libelous postings even if they are not the actual authors of the content.
 
(2) Not only those that were identifiable via a name or pseudonym but also via IP (internet protocol) numbers and those that own a computer might have to defend themselves of the activities that were done under these identifiers. This would have chilling effects on the freedom of expression at public forums, blogs and news sites even if these publications represent someone else’s opinion.      
 
(3) In protest against this amendment the Centre for Independent Journalism organized the Internet Blackout Day (14 August 2012) in Malaysia to no avail. Section 114A was passed after the second and third reading. On 9 May, Dewan Negara (Senate) passed the amendment. The amendment was gazetted on 22 June 2012. This means the law is now operational.]

 

Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of Malaysia for an Economic Partnership, July 13, 2006
 
[The Agreement contains Article 122 (2): “Each Country shall provide for appropriate measures concerning limitations on liability for service providers: (a) in case where a service provider provides a necessary deterrent to the transmission of information through telecommunication systems or networks controlled or operated by the service provider which it believes to be the infringement of copyright or related rights; and (b) in case where the infringement of copyright or related rights occurs by the transmission of information through telecommunication systems or networks controlled or operated by a service provider and where the service provider is technically unable to deter the transmission or has difficulty in finding the infringement of copyright or related rights.]


 
Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Act of 1998 (CMA 1998), Act 588
 
[This Act provides a legal mandate to defend a free and open internet. Malaysia is one of the only countries in the world where a free and open internet is mandated by law. This mandate is overseen by the Malaysian Multimedia and Communications Commission (MMCC), an independent regulator tasked with oversight of mobile and internet providers (see below).
 
(1) Section 3(3) CMA 1998 states: “Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting the censorship of the Internet.” 
 

(2) The CMA sets out the conditions for Malaysia’s objectives to create a national policy framework for the convergence industries. It establishes Codes of practice to self-regulate the content industries. 
 
(i) Section 213 CMA 1998 makes clear that a Content Code should be drafted in such a way as to provide model procedures for dealing with offensive or indecent content. Despite Section 3(3) CMA 1998, Section 213 CMA 1998 provides a non-exhaustive list of broadly worded categories for a Content Code which should include restrictions on the provision of unsuitable content; methods of classifying content; procedures for handling public complaints and for reporting information about complaints to the Commission; the representation of Malaysian culture and national identity; public information and education regarding content regulation and technologies for the end user control of content; and other matters of concern to the community. 
 
(ii) Section 95 CMA 1998 states that “An industry forum may prepare a voluntary industry code dealing with any matter provided for in this Act – (a) on its own initiative; or (b) upon request by the Commission. 
 
(iii) Section 99 CMA 1998 states that the Commission may direct a person or a class of persons to comply with a registered voluntary industry code. 
 
(iv) Section 98(2) CMA 1998 states that “[c]ompliance with a registered voluntary industry code shall be a defence against any prosecution, action or proceeding of any nature, whether in a court or otherwise, taken against a person (who is subject to the voluntary industry code) regarding a matter dealt with in that code.”
 
Malaysian Multimedia and Communications Commission Act 1998 (MMCCA 1998), Act 589
 
[(1) The MMCCA was passed to create a Commission to supervise the implementation of the CMA 1998.
 
(2) The CMA 1998 does not define ‘industry’ or ‘multimedia’. According to Rahman, the chairman of the MMCC, Dr Syed Hussein Mohamed, has indicated that it includes broadcasting, telecommunications and the internet. See Nor Saadah Abd Rahman, Copyright in the Internet with reference to Malaysia, Durham theses, Durham University (2004), 234.
 
(3) The Commission is also responsible for the granting or rejecting of mandatory licenses, see Sections 27 and 117 CMA 1998.]

 

Copyright Act of 1987, Act 322, December 1, 1987
 
[Section 36(1) Copyright Act 1987 provided a measure against primary infringers “Copyright is infringed by any person who does”, and secondary infringers “or causes any other person to do,” without the licence of the owner of the copyright, an act the doing of which is controlled by copyright under this Act.
 
According to Daniel Seng, the Copyright Act 1987 is based on the UK Copyright Act 1911, hence UK cases on the element of “authorizing infringement” will be highly persuasive to Malaysian courts. Because of the emphasis on control that a secondary defendant has to exercise over a primary infringer in U.K. cases to be held liable for “causing” the primary infringer to commit an infringing act, Seng believed that if Malaysian courts would follow U.K. case law it was unlikely that they would find an Internet intermediary liable for the acts of its users or subscribers.” See Daniel Seng, Comparative Analysis of the National Approaches to the Liability of Internet Intermediaries, Internet Intermediaries and Creative Content, WIPO 2011, 32, para 84.]
 

Copyright Amendments Act of 1990 (Act A775), and 2012 (Act 1420), before amended in 1996 (Act A952), 1997 (Act A994), 2000 (Act A1082), 2002 (Act A1139) and 2003 (Act 1195)   
 
[In 2012 Section 36(1) Copyright Act 1987 remains unaltered in the amendment (Act A1420) of 2012. However, Part VIB ‘Limitation of Liabilities of the Service Provider’ Sections 43B-I, was added which provides a safe harbor provision for internet intermediary liability for copyright infringement. The provisions are similar to the DMCA in the US in which ISPs and content aggregators are provided immunity from liability for copyright infringement if they protect copyright owners by removing or disabling access to infringing content. 
 

43B. Interpretation
 
A service provider is a person who provides services relating to, or provides connections for, the access, transmission or routing of data; or operates facilities for, online services or network access.    
 
43C. Transmission, routing and provision of connections
 
(1) A service provider shall not be held liable for copyright infringement for the transmission or routing of or providing connections to an infringing work; or any transient storage thereof; under the following conditions: the transmission, routing, provision of connections or storage of the electronic copy of the infringing work was not initiated by the service provider; is carried out through an automatic technical process, does not make any modification, and does not select the recipient, except as an automatic response. 
 
(2) The court may order the service provider to take reasonable steps to disable access to an online location that is physically situated outside Malaysia; or terminate a specified account.
 
43D. System caching
 
The service provider shall not be held liable for system caching. 
 
43E. Storage and information location tools
 
(1) The service provider shall not be held liable for storing infringing work at the direction of a user of its primary network; or linking a user via a hyperlink, directory or search engine to an online location which makes an infringing work available. Under the condition that the service provider: 
 
(i) does not have actual knowledge that the electronic copy of the work or activity is infringing; is not aware of the facts or circumstances from which the infringing activity is apparent, which is the red flag requirement (contributory liability);
(ii) that the service provider does not receive any financial benefit directly attributable to the infringement of the copyright and that the service provider does not have the right and ability to control the infringing activity (vicarious liability); 
(iii) that upon receipt of a notification of any infringement, the service provider responds within the time specified to remove or disable access to the material. If no notification is given the service provider shall not be held liable.  
 
(2) A test is given for vicarious liability, which includes taking into account any industry practice in relation to charging of services by a service provider. 
 
43F. Exemption of service provider from liability for removal of copy or other activities from network
 
(1) The service provider is not liable for the removal or disabling of content in good faith, but he shall notify “as far as may be practicable” the person who made available the electronic copy and also show him the notification received from the copyright owner.   
 
(2) If the person who made the copy available settled with the copyright owner or was adjudicated by any court or tribunal as the rightful copyright owner, the service provider shall “as far as practicable” restore the electronic copy to its primary network or restore access to the electronic 
 
(3) If a service provider had solely provided a facility which was used by a person to infringe a copyrighted work he did not authorize the copyright infringement of copyright. 
 
43G. Information on service provider
 
If the service provider would like to fall under the safe harbor provision he needs to make accessible his name and address and provide details and particulars of a designated agent to receive any complaint or notice regarding an allegation of infringement of copyright.  
 
43H. Notification by copyright owner and its effect
 
(1) The copyright holder can notify the service provider to remove or disable any access to copyright infringing content, provided that the copyright owner shall compensate the service provider or any other person against any damages, loss or liability arising from the compliance by the service provider of such notification.
 
(2) The service provider shall remove or disable any access to work that is infringing copyright within 48 hours after he received the notification.   
 
(3) The person whose electronic copy was removed or to which access has been disabled may issue to the service provider a counter notification, after which the service provider needs to restore the electronic copy or access to it, provided that the person shall undertake to compensate the service provider or any other person against any damages, loss or liability arising from the compliance by the service provider of such counter notification. A counter notification to the service provider’s designated agent should contain a statement under penalty of perjury that the issuer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. 
 
(4) The service provider needs to promptly provide the issuer of the notification (copyright owner or alleged copyright owner) with a copy of the counter notification and inform such issuer that the removed material or access to the said material will be restored in ten business days, he received another notification of the copyright owner or alleged copyright owner that he filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the issuer of the counter notification from engaging in any infringing activity. 
 
43I. Maker of false notice guilty of offence and liable in damages
 
(1) If a person making a notification makes any statement which is false, which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both; and he shall be liable to compensate any person who suffers any loss or damages as a result of making the notification. 
 
(2) It does not make any difference whether a person makes the statement inside or outside Malaysia.]
 
[See also Malaysia International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) 2013 Special 301 Report on Copyright Protection and Enforcement, February 8, 2013, 311 arguing that
 
(1) Malaysia’s safe harbor provisions can be improved if: (i) it will be made clear that the duties to cooperate are triggered by a compliant notice or if the service provider knows or is aware of facts and circumstances from which the infringement is apparent; (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief can be used in case of uncooperative service providers; (iii)service providers have in place a fair and effective termination policy for repeat infringers and that those that fail to inform their customers and implement such a policy would not be eligible for the safe harbors.
 
(2) The IIPA also criticized the “48-hour” rule for takedowns, which they deem “too slow for “pre-release” materials (movies, music, games, software, or published materials not yet available in Malaysia).” Since automated takedown technologies exist, they argue that takedown timeframes should be immediate or no longer than a couple of hours.]






Self-Regulation


Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code, September 1, 2004 
 
[The Code was officially registered with the MMCC with effect from 1 September 1, 2004.
 
(1) Paragraph 6.4 Content Code states that apart from the relevant legislation under the CMA 1998, “all applicable Malaysian Laws including but not limited to sedition, pornography, defamation, protection of intellectual property and other related legislation are to be complied with.” 
 
(2) Paragraph 2.0 provides a definition of the innocent carrier concept, which corresponds to Sections 43B, C, D and E, in the sense that when code subjects provide access to any content but have neither control over the composition of such content nor any knowledge of such content they are deemed innocent carriers, therefore not responsible for the content provided. 
Nonetheless, this does not exempt such access providers from adhering to the General measures as outlined in Part 6.0 of this Part where it expressly applies to them.
 
(3) The obligations to remove or disable access to alleged infringing content after a notification are provided for four categories of code subjects, classified as Internet Access Service Provider (para 7.0), Content Aggregator (para 8.0), Link Provider (para 9.0) and Internet Content Hosting Provider (para 10).
 
Communications and Multimedia Content Forum of Malaysia (CMCF), February 2001
 
[The CMCF was established in February 2001 under the CMA 1998 to govern electronic content and address content related issues. Designated by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) on 29 March 2001, the CMCF is made up of six member categories: advertisers, audiotext hosting service providers, broadcasters, civic groups, content creators/distributors and Internet Access Service Providers in Malaysia.] 



BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Trans-Pacific Partnership 
 
[(1) Malaysia is one of the negotiating partners of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. The intellectual property chapter of one of the drafts was published by WikiLeaks in November 2013.
 
(2) It is clear that a notice and take down procedure is on the wish list of some countries. Article QQ.I.1 Malaysia, conform its current legislation, proposes that “Each Party shall limit the liability of, or the availability of remedies against, internet service providers.” 
 
(3) Malaysia opposes Canada’s proposal that “Eligibility for the limitations in the previous paragraph may not be conditioned on the internet service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.”
 
Internet Filtering Plan, 2009
 
[Malaysia considered the establishment of an internet filter similar to the Green Dam project in China. Niluksi Koswanage, Malaysia Examines Internet Filter, Tougher Controls, Reuters, Aug. 6, 2009. Malaysia did not do it since it would hurt freedom and foreign direct investments. Razak Ahmad and Royce Cheah, Malaysia Backs off Internet Filter Plan, Reuters, Aug. 7, 2009.  The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, which issued the tender, said it was a study on Internet usage so as to boost Malaysian content on the Internet and that reports of a filter were “sensationalized”. But a copy of the tender documents, seen by Reuters, appeared to contradict that statement. Niluksi Koswanage and Razak Ahmad, Malaysia to Cancel Internet Filter, Reuters, Aug. 12, 2009.]

DECISIONS



[There are currently no known cases that have been brought before the courts on the issue of intermediary liability. In Malaysia breach of copyright is normally handled under criminal jurisdiction of the Sessions Court (the highest in the lower court hierarchy). Normally cases are not reported. The enforcement is normally done by the enforcement division of the Ministry of Domestic Trade, not by the Malaysian Intellectual Property Office (MyIPO), which is practically a registration authority.]
 


Administrative Procedures



[According to Esther Low, an associate with Wong & Partners, interviewed by Peter Leung, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, at the request of the Ministry Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism - ordered all ISPs to block 10 file-sharing websites, including Megavideo and Pirate Bay. Low: “The prescribed take-down procedures under the Copyright Amendment Act of 2012 will work with this existing framework in fighting piracy”.

LEGISLATION


[Under Kenyan law, no provision specially addresses the issue of intermediary liability. There are no stated take down laws, policies or procedures. There is also no safe harbour for intermediaries or similar provisions limiting their liability. However, the activities of the intermediaries are assessed and regulated according to general provisions of criminal or civil liability. Under this framework, Intermediaries are responsible for filtering, removing and blocking content that is considered illegal, e.g. under crimial law or copyright, information communication, or hate speech legislation. However, they have no obligation to monitor traffic on their networks unless they are made aware of an illegal/unauthorized content or activity. The relevant provisions are detailed below.]
 

Consumer Protection Act of 2012
 
[Section 11(1) provides that “no person shall advertise an internet gaming site that is operated contrary to any written law” and Section 11(2) provides that “no person, other than an internet service provider, shall arrange for or otherwise facilitate advertising prohibited under subsection (1) on behalf of another person.” Although confusing, the wording of these sections does not allow illegal activity for ISPs, but rather introduces a ""safe harbour"" exception so that an ISP can continue operating even if there are adverts (of which it has knowledge or does not have knowledge) that are illegal. Also, section 11(3) states ""For the purpose of subsection (1), a person advertises an internet gaming site only if the advertising originates in Kenya or is primarily intended for Kenya residents.""]
 
Information Communication Act of 2009, CAP 411 A
 
[(1) Section 24-25 establishes the requirement of license to operate or provide telecommunication systems and services;  under the Unified Licencing Framework (ULF) operated by the Communication Commission of Kenya (CCK), there are 3 categories of  internet intermediaries, which need to be licensed: (i) Network Facilities Provider (NFP), owning and operating any form of communications infrastructure (based on satellite, terrestrial, mobile or fixed); (ii) Applications Service Provider (ASP), providing all forms of services to end users using the network services of a facilities provider; (iii) Contents Services Provider (CSP), providing contents services such as broadcast (TV& Radio) material, and other information services and data processing services, etc.
 
(2) Section 27 empowers the Miniter in charge of communications to make rules in consultation with the CCK pertaining to the telecommunications system, thus the minister may introduce new obligation for intermediaries;
 
(2) Section 29 prohibits improper use of a system by sending a message or other matter that is false offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing character; 
 
(3) Section 30 prohibits the intentional modification or interference with the contents of a message sent by means of a telecommunication system, by persons licensed to run a telecommunication system;
 
(4) Section 31 prohibits licensed operators from intercepting and/or disclosing the contents of a message sent through the system;  
 
(5) Section 46(I) lists the responsibilities of broadcasters including to respect the rights to privacy of individuals and to respect the copyrights or any neighbouring right to any work or material; 
 
(6) Section 84(D) prohibits the publishing or transmitting of obscene information in electronic form; and 
 
(7) Section 93 provides general restrictions on disclosure of information.]
 
Information and Communications (electronic Certification and Domain Name Administration) Regulations, 2010 [Rule 26 provides that “[a] registrant shall bear liability for the infringement of third party rights and interest arising from holding or using a domain name in the ccTLD.]
 
National Cohesion And Integration Act No. 12 of 2008
 
[Section 13 creates the offence of Hate Speech. Section 62 makes an offense for any media enterprise to publish words intended to incite feelings of contempt, hatred, hostility, violence or discrimination against any person, group or community on the basis of ethnicity or race.]
 
Sexual Offences Act of 2006, last amended by Act No. 12 of 2012
 
[(1) Section 12 makes it an offense for any person to distribute, supply or display any article that is intended to encourage or enable a child to be engaged on in sexual act;
 
(2) Section 14 prohibits child pornography which involves distribution and receiving profits from distribution of obscene materials to a child;
 
(3) Section 19 criminalizes the publishing of information intended to promote or facilitate conduct that would constitute a sexual offence against a person living with disabilities.]
 
Copyright Act of 2001, CAP 130 
 
[(1) Section 26 describes the nature of copyright in literary, audio-visual and musical or artistic works. It provides for the exclusive right of copyright holder to control reproduction and distribution of their works to the public;
 
(2) Section 35 defines and describes what constitutes copyright infringement and imposes criminal liability for distribution or making available to the public protected works without a license;
 
(3) Section 38 lists the offences and penalties for copyright infringement including the making and distribution of protected works without a license.
 
(4) Neither the Copyright Act nor other legislation imposes specific penalties on service providers for failing to block or remove infringing content. However, the continued existence of copyright material on a website, can be construed as a continuing violation and thus fall under the ‘distribution’ clause under s. 35 and 38 of the Copyright Act, thus giving rise to liability.]
 
Penal Code, CAP 63
 
[Chapter XVIII defines and describes defamation as an offence. Section 194 makes any person who unlawfully publishes defamatory matter with intent to injure or defame another person liable for defamation.]


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Data Protection Bill 2013
 
[This bill will be enacted to give effect to article 31(c) (d) of the Kenyan Constitution on regulation, collection, and disclosure of personal data and connected purposes. (1) Section 8 prescribes the manner in which personal data is to be collected; (2) Section 11 imposes a duty on any agency that holds personal data to ensure its protection and security; (3) Section 17 gives the restrictions on commercial use of personal data.]
 
Electronic Transactions Bill of 2007 (withdrawn)
 
[(1) This Bill contained key provisions on intermediary liability which finally were not integrated into the Information and Communication Act of 2009 and was partially inspired by the EU Commerce Directive.
 
(2) It provided for ‘safe harbours’ limiting civil and criminal liability for service providers in respect of third parties where they acted as mere conduits, when hosting, with respect of caching processes, and where they used information location tools.
 
(3) Further, it provided for a notice and take-down procedure for addressing complaints of infringement of rights, while also granting service providers immunity for any actions taken once notified of the infringing activity.
 

(4) Clause 27 stated that service providers were not under any general obligation to monitor data transmitted or stored or to actively seek facts or circumstances which were indicative of unlawful activity, although they were required to monitorand report unlawful activity once they were aware.
 
(5) However, the limitation on liability proposed under the bill did not extend to obligations such as those founded on contract, those imposed by law or court processes, and those based on common law or statute.

DECISIONS



Lower Courts

High Court of Kenya at Nairobi, Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta v Muchemi Wachira and Nation Media Group, 2013
[defamation, hosting provider, news platform, users' comments]
 
[The defamatory material for which Nation Media Group (NMG) was found liable consisted partly of comments posted on the NMG’s website by members of the public in response to a news article that Muchemi Wachira had posted on NMG's website. The court found NMG liable for defamation by virtue of its role in publishing the comments on its site and for not exercising control in removing the defamatory comments posted by the public. According to this decision, intermediaries have an obligation to remove allegedly defamatory material, which comes to their notice, either as a result of a complaint by the allegedly defamed person or otherwise. The obligation to remove the infringing material does not depend upon the determination of the court.]
 
[There are currently no other known cases that have been brought before the courts on the issue of intermediary liability. However, a few other cases have delt with direct infringment of online intermediaries and defamation through social networking sites. They are mentioned below as they may contain useful insights.]
 
High Court of Kenya at Nairobi, John Boniface Maina v Safaricom Limited, [2013] eKLR, Civil Suit No. 808 fo 2012, May 14, 2013
[copyright, mobile telecom, ringtones]
 
[The plaintiff, a musician, successfully sued the defendant, a mobile telecommunication company for breach of copyright. The defendant had introduced a caller back ring tone service where they distributed the plaintiff music without authorization. The defendant was restrained from infringing upon the plaintiff’s copyright by offering for sale, selling or storing of any data relating to the plaintiff’s musical works. The defendant was also ordered to remove all the plaintiffs musical works from the website.] 
 
High Court of Kenya at Nairobi, Duncan Muriuki V. Baobab Resort, Petition no. 223 of 2012, June 12, 2013 
[Defamation, Hotel, Facebook page]
[This is an ongoing case where the plaintiff complained that some words published on the hotel’s Facebook page were defamatory. Interlocutory order was obtained requiring the respondent to remove infringing content posted.]

LEGISLATION


Executive Order of the Supreme Leader Establishing the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, March 2012 
 
[The Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC) serves as the centralized authority regarding policymaking, decision-making, and coordination in the realm of cyberspace. All state agencies - not excluding the Iranian Parliament - are required to cooperate with the SCC. This effectively grants the SCC unilateral authority regarding Iran's internet policy and the power to compel other government agencies, e.g., the Committee for Determining Instances of Criminal Web Content, to issue policies and verdicts at the SCC's will.]
 
Computer Crimes Law, June 2009
 
[(1) Article 21 of Iran's Computer Crimes Law (CCL) imposes liability on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that fail to filter internet content that “generates crime.” Penalties for the violating the crime depend on the ISP's intention and number of prior offenses, and include fines and liquidation of the ISP.
 
(2) The legality of online content is determined a body created in Article 22 of the CCL, now known as the Committee for Determining Instances of Criminal Web Content. Article 23 charges ISPs with implementing the orders of the Committee and imposes a reporting requirement on ISPs to inform the Committee upon encountering illegal content. 
 
(3) Additionally, Articles 15 and 17 do not specifically reference ISP liability, but could be referenced in cases against them. Article 15 outlaws facilitating others’ access to obscene content, with ""obscene"" left very loosely defined. Article 17 criminalizes the use of a computer or telecommunication system to make available someone else’s personal images, audio, or video files without their consent in a way that brings disrepute to that person.]
 


Administrative Regulations

Regulatory Entity: Supreme Council of Cyberspace
 
[The Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC) was established by the order of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As stated in the SCC's charter, the body is tasked with writing the policies that govern the usage of internet exchange points (IXPs) and content for filtering.]
 
Regulatory Entity: Committee for Determining Instances of Criminal Web Content
 
[Under the Computer Crimes Law, the Committee for Determining Instances of Criminal Web Content (CDICWC) is the regulatory entity, which is entitled to issue orders against ISPs regarding the legality, blocking and removal of online content. The orders of the CDICWC do not involve judicial review and the ISPs must comply under severe penalties. The CDICWC is under the authority of the Supreme Court of Cyberspace.]



BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

[There are currently no known new legislative proposals on the issue of intermediary liability.] 

DECISIONS
[There are currently no known cases that have been brought before courts on the issue of intermediary liability. Reports of a southern Iranian court summoning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to trial in May 2014 were later denied by the Chief Prosector of the Shiraz province. Howeve, acting under the order of the SCC, the regulatory entity CDICWC has issued verdicts against a number of messaging platforms and social media sites. These verdicts do not involve lawsuits, but are instructions for filtering issued by the CDICWC and implemented by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (ICT Ministry).]

Administrative procedures


Committee for Determining Instances of Criminal Web Content, Administrative Procedures
 
[Since 2009, the CDICWC has issued decisions regarding in the intermittent blocking of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and WeChat. In Febraury 2014, the CDICWC also stated it is considering blocking the app Viber, though it had not yet reached a decision.]

LEGISLATION


[There is currently no specific legislation on the issue of intermediary liability, however bills and proposals are pending before the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (see below).]


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS
Copyright Amendment Bill 2014 
 
[(1) Establishing a statutory ‘safe harbour’ for OSPs so that their liabilities for copyright infringement occurring on their service platforms could be limited, provided that OSPs meet certain prescribed conditions, including the taking of reasonable steps to limit or stop copyright infringement when being notified.
 
(2) The proposal aims at facilitating OSPs’ handling of alleged infringement balancing the interests between copyright owners and users. Under the proposed ‘safe harbour’ provisions, OSPs’ liabilities for copyright infringement occurring on their service platforms could be limited provided that they meet certain prescribed conditions, including the taking of reasonable steps to limit or stop copyright infringement when being notified.
 
(3) The ‘safe harbour’ will be underpinned by a Code of Practice which sets out practical guidelines and procedures for OSPs to follow upon notification of infringement such as ""notice-and-notice"" and ""notice-and-takedown"". The proposal aims at facilitating OSPs’ handling of alleged infringements balancing the interests between copyright owners and users.] [See Stanford CIS blog post]
 

Consultation on Draft Code of Practice for the reference of Online Service Providers (8 August 2011 to 9 September 2011)
 
[When HK government introduced the 2011 Copyright (Amendment) Bill into the Legislative Council, it also brought into sight the statutory ‘safe harbour’ for OSPs so as to protect their potential liability for copyright infringement on their platforms with a non-statutory Code of Practice that sets out the procedures for copyright owners to serve notices of alleged infringement and for subscribers to serve counter notices, the draft was finalized in 2012:
 
(a) Instead of setting a specific time frame within which OSPs must take action to limit and stop a particular infringement, the revised draft Code requires OSPs to act as soon as practicable;
 
(b) In view of the privacy concerns raised by some respondents, HK has made changes under which a subscriber may choose to request the OSP not to disclose his personal data when sending a copy of the subscriber's counter notice to the complainant;
 
(c) OSPs will be required to keep records of the notices of alleged infringement and counter notices received for a period of 18 months. Such records are required for law enforcement purposes; and
 
(d) Both the complainants and subscribers will be required to provide more information to substantiate their infringement claims and counter claims respectively. This is to facilitate the resolution of disputes in a quicker and more cost-effective manner.]

Superior Courts


Court of Final Appeals, Oriental Press Group Ltd. v. Fevaworks Solutions Ltd, HKCFA 47, 2013
[OSPs, defamation]
 
[Holding online intermediaries of discussion forums as secondary publishers with liabilities imposed from outset, who also have the duties to monitor and take active actions when noticed of defamatory activities on their platform. Defendants were administrators, providers and managers of a website that hosted one of most popular Internet discussion forums in Hong Kong, known as the Golden Forum. Plaintiffs were publishers of the Oriental Press Groups, one of the most popular local newspapers. Three entries were posted in the defendants’ forum accusing plaintiffs dealing with money laundering, drug trafficking and bribery, etc. Defendants removed two entries with due notice but the last one was removed eight months after being informed. Lower court held the forum for not having duly removed this entry without reasonable delay. Defamation Ordinance of Hong Kong does not cover ISPs liabilities issues, so the Court relied on common law secondary liabilities and found the forum liable for the alleged delay. The Court limited the OSPs’ liability as secondary or subordinate publisher in the way of its limited manpower to monitor and control the discussion, but it also argued that the defendants should promptly take all reasonable steps to remove the offending content from their platform as soon as it becomes reasonably practicable after notice.]

LEGISLATION

Copyright Act, as amended on January 22, 2014
 
[(1) Intermediary Liability of Copyright Infringement. The inducement liability of copyright infringement was enacted in 2007 under the influence of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, MGM v. Grokster, 545 U.S. 913 (2005). However, there is a critical difference between them with regard to the requirement of the resulting acts of infringement by a third party. In Grokster, the court holds that “one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.” However, according to the subparagraph 7 of paragraph 1, article 87 of Taiwan’s Copyright Act, the intermediary’s behavior of enabling copyright infringement itself can be deemed an infringement of copyright under certain circumstances. In other words, a resulting act of copyright infringement by a third party is not a required element of the inducement liability in Taiwan’s Copyright Act. The view is supported by the legislative document of the enactment, which states that the amendment is to prohibit the behavior of inducing copyright infringement.
 
Article 87. Any of the following circumstances, except as otherwise provided under this Act, shall be deemed an infringement of copyright or plate rights: [ . . . ] 7. To provide to the public computer programs or other technology that can be used to publicly transmit or reproduce works, with the intent to allow the public to infringe economic rights by means of public transmission or reproduction by means of the Internet of the works of another, without the consent of or a license from the economic rights holder, and to receive benefit therefrom. A person who undertakes the actions set out in subparagraph 7 above shall be deemed to have ""intent"" pursuant to that subparagraph when the advertising or other active measures employed by the person instigates, solicits, incites, or persuades the public to use the computer program or other technology provided by that person for the purpose of infringing upon the economic rights of others. 
Article 91 to  93 provide the relevant penalties for copyright infringement. In particular, Article 93 states that a sentence of up to two years imprisonment or detention shall be imposed, or in lieu thereof or in addition thereto, a fine of not more than five hundred thousand New Taiwan Dollars for the violation of subparagraph 7 of paragraph 1 of Article 87.
 
(2) Limitations on Civil Liability for Internet Service Providers (ChapterVI-1). The limitations on civil liability for Internet service providers were enacted during 2009 in Taiwan. They largely follow the framework of section 512 of DMCA. The internet service providers are divided into four categories -- connection service providers, caching service providers, information storage service providers, and search service providers – with different conditions of eligibility of limitation on liability.
 
Article 90-5. A connection service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if— 1. the transmission of the information was initiated by or at the request of the user; and 2. the transmission, routing, provision of connections, or storage is carried out through an automatic technical process, without any selection of the material or modification of its content by the connection service provider.
Article 90-6. A caching service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if— 1. the service provider does not make any modification to the cached information; 2. when the person who made the original information available subsequently update, deletes, or blocks access to it, the cached information is done in the same way as a result of an automatic technical process; and 3. the service provider responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information upon notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of the alleged infringement by the user of the service provider.
Article 90-7. An information storage service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if the service provider— 1. does not have knowledge of the allegedly infringing activity of the user; 2. does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity of the user; and 3. responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information upon notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of the alleged infringement by the user of the service provider.
Article 90-8. A search service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if the service provider— 1. does not have knowledge that the searched or linked information may be infringing; 2. does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity of the user; and 3. responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information upon notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of the alleged infringement by the user of the service provider.
 
In addition, all the internet service providers need to meet the requirements of article 90-4 in order to be eligible for the limitations on liability.
 
Article 90-4. An Internet service provider shall be entitled to the application of Article 90sexies to Article 90novies regarding the limitation on liability only if the service provider— 1. by contract, electronic transmission, automatic detective system or other means, informs users of its copyright or plate right protection policy, and takes concrete action to implement it; and 2. by contract, electronic transmission, automatic detective system or other means, informs users that in the event of repeat alleged infringements up to three times the service provider shall terminate the service in whole or in part; and 3. publicly announces information regarding its contact window for receipt of notification documents. 4. accommodate and implement the technical measure described in paragraph 3. A connection service provider that, after receiving notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of alleged infringement by a user, has forwarded the notification to that particular user by electronic mail is deemed to have met the requirement in the preceding paragraph, subparagraph 1. If a copyright holder or plate rights holder has provided technical measures which have been developed based on a broad consensus and are used to identify or protect copyrighted or plate-righted works, the Internet service provider shall accommodate and implement the measures if the technical measures has been ratified by the competent authority.
 
With respect to information storage service providers, there are provisions for notice and takedown (Article 90-10).
 
Article 90-9. An information storage service provider shall forward notice to the allegedly infringing user of any measures taken under Article 90octies, subparagraph 3, by the contact method stipulated between the service provider and the user or by the contact information left by the user. However, this requirement shall not apply if the nature of the service provided makes such notice impossible. If a user referred to in the preceding paragraph believes that the materials were not involved in infringement, the user may submit counter notification documents to the information storage service provider with a request to restore the removed content or related information or restore the access to it. Upon receipt of a counter notification described in the preceding paragraph, an information storage service provider shall expeditiously forward such documents to the copyright holder or plate rights holder. If, within 10 business days since one day after the date of receiving counter notification from the information storage service provider as described in the preceding paragraph, the copyright holder or plate rights holder provides the information storage service provider with evidence regarding filing civil or criminal litigation against the user, the information storage service provider shall not bear any obligation to restore the content or related information. If the copyright holder or plate rights holder fails to provide evidence on filing litigation in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the information storage service provider shall, within no more than 14 business days since one day after the date of forwarding the counter-notification documents, restore the removed content or related information or restore the access to it. However, if restoration is impossible, the service provider shall notify the user in advance, or provide another appropriate method by which the user may restore it.
Article 90-10. An Internet service provider shall not be liable for damages to the allegedly infringing user if the service provider— 1. removes, or disables access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information in accordance with Articles 90septies to 90novies; or 2. upon obtaining knowledge of suspected infringement by the user, acts in good faith belief to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information.
Article 90-11. A person who misrepresents an Internet service provider with a notification or counter notification out of intention or negligence shall be liable for damages for any injury incurred on the user, copyright holder, plate right holder or Internet Service Provider.
Article 90-12. The information in connection with the public announcement of the contact window under Article 90quinquies, and the content of the notification and counter notification, required particulars, supplementation or correction, and other requisite matters under Articles 90septies through 90decies shall be prescribe by the competent authority.
 
Because the amendment in 2009 only refers to the limitations on civil liability for Internet service providers in its title, it is not clear the limitation also applies to criminal liability. The question is very important in the context of Taiwan since most copyright cases in Taiwan are litigated through criminal proceedings. Currently, according to the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office, the limitation also applies to criminal liability because it deems that once an intermediary follow the notice and takedown procedure, it has no intention in infringing copyright and hence cannot be convicted of infringing copyright.]
 
(3) Three-strikes Law. Article 90-4(2) (see above), the so-called three-strikes law, stipulates that an Internet service provider is entitled to limitation on civil liability only if it informs users that in the event of repeated alleged infringement up to three times, it shall terminate the service. However, unlike paragraph 1, which requires Internet service providers “to take concrete action to implement it,” paragraph 3 has no equivalent requirement. Arguably, an Internet service provider may be entitled to the limitation on liability simply by informing users of the consequence of repeated alleged infringements—by contract, electronic transmission or other means—without actually terminating the service.]  

 
Criminal Code, as amended on January 15, 2014
 
[Joint Criminal Enterprise Liability and Aiding Liability. Article 15. A person who has a legal obligation and is able to prevent the results of the occurrence of an offense but has failed to do so shall be equal to have caused the occurrence of the result by his positive act. If a conduct of a person causes the danger of producing the result of an offense, the person has a legal obligation to prevent the occurrence of the result. Article 28. Each of the two or more persons acting jointly in the commission of an offense is a principal offender. Article 29 A person who aids another in the commission of a crime is an accessory notwithstanding that the person aided does not know of the assistance.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS
Bill on Telecommunication Act
[A telecommunications enterprise is required to remove content if an ""administrative agency"" (not a court) in authority deems that the content violate a law or regulation, such as copyright or defamation law, and the removal is technically possible (paragraph 2 of article 9). The bill was temporally shelved in 2013 due to the controversy, but it is likely the bill will be sent to the Legislature Yuan again with some revision in the future.]
 
Taiwan Intellectual Property Office (TIPO) Bill [TIPO's Press Release]
[There was a controversial SOPA-like bill proposed by Taiwan Intellectual Property Office (TIPO) last year, which authorized TIPO to block websites from other jurisdictions if it deems the role of website in contributing copyright infringement is ""obvious."" The bill was withdrawn due the severe opposition from online communities and significant coverage in media.]

LEGISLATION

Law No. 22 of 1992 on the Protection of Copyright, as amended on March 31, 2005
 
[The Copyright Law in Jordan has no specific provisions dealing with the liability of Online Service Providers (OSPs). It contains no provisions that expressly deal with secondary liability.]
 
Civil Code, Law No. 43 of 1976
 
[(1) In the absence of a provision in the Copyright Law, secondary liability is dealt with general tort law principles of joint liability under the Jordanian civil legal system.
 
(2) The Jordanian Civil Code is the primary source of law that should be consulted in cases as there is no specific provision in the Copyright Law in Jordan.
 
(3) Article 256 of the Jordanian Civil Code provides that ""[e]very injurious act shall render the person who commits it liable for damages even if he is a non-discerning person."" Three elements must be present for tort liability to arise under the Jordanian Civil Code: (i) a fault or error (which may be either an act or a failure to act); (ii) damage to another; and (iii) a causal connection between the fault and damage.
 
(4) “Vicarious liability” is not strictly defined in the Jordanian Civil Code as in the case of French law. (i) The major provisions concerning liability for another person’s act are to be found in Article 288 of the Jordanian Civil Code, which provides that: ""1. No person shall be liable for the act of another and yet the court may on the application of the injured person and if it finds justifiable hold liable for the awarded damages. A. Any person who is under a legal or a contractual obligation to supervise a person in need of supervision due to his minority or his mental or physical condition, unless he proves that he has fulfilled his duty of supervision or that damage was to be inflicted even though he fulfilled his duty of supervision or that the damage was to be inflicted even though he fulfilled his duty of exercising the necessary care. B. Any person who had actual power to supervise and direct the person who had inflicted the damage even though he himself had no free choice if the injurious act was committed by the supervised person while or because of performing the duties of his position."" (ii) Article 288 of the Jordanian Civil Code is influenced by Islamic jurisprudence. It states a general rule on liability and then provides limitations to it. The judge has limited powers to determine those limitations, subject to the provisions of the law. It is submitted that it would be difficult to apply Article 288(B) to online service providers, as OSPs might not have any authority, supervision or direction over the person who is infringing copyright works online, especially with the use of the second generation of P2P networks.

LEGISLATION

The Copyright Act of 2007 (Unofficial English Version)
 
[Section 18 establishes the permitted uses within the framework of the Copyright Act, these permitted uses are set out in Sections 19-30. Section 26 deals with “temporary copies” created in the context of communications network, operated by an intermediary entity. According to Section 26 such transient copying, including incidental copying, is permitted if the copying is: (i) an integral part of a technological process and the only purpose of which is to enable transmission; (ii) between two parties, thorough a communication network, by an intermediary entity, or any other lawful use of the work; (iii) provided the said copy does not have significant economic value in itself. In addition, Section 58 defines an “Innocent Infringer”. In case an infringer “did not know, or could not have known, at the time of the infringement, that copyright subsists in the work” such innocent infringer “shall not be obligated to pay compensation in respect of the said infringement”, although this section is quite narrow and it could be applied in certain cases to intermediary liability.]
 
Tort Ordinance (New Version) (Unofficial English Version)
 
[Stipulation of the Tort Ordinance and common law tort law could be made use in the context of intermediary liability with respect to copyright issues because Section 52 of the Copyright Act states that “Infringement of copyright […] is a civil wrong and the provisions of the Ordinance on Torts (New Version) shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the provisions of this Act”. Section 12 of the Tort Ordinance states that “for the purposes of this Ordinance, any person who joins or aids in, authorises, counsels, commands, procures or ratifies any act done or to be done, or any omission made or to be made, by any other person will be liable for such act or omission.” This broad definition could be used to establish intermediary liability in the context of copyright infringement. In fact, reference use of intermediary liability through tort law has been made by The Supreme Court in its decision in the case of The Football Association Premier League Ltd v John Doe.]
 
Unjust Enrichment Act, 1979 (Unofficial English Version)
 
[This act does not deal specifically with Intermediary Liability but it could be used in certain cases to claim unjust enrichment by the intermediary by the infringing act. Section 1 states “when a person (hereinafter: beneficiary) obtains any property, service or other benefit from another person (hereinafter: benefactor) without legal cause, then the beneficiary will make restitution to the benefactor, and if restitution in kind is impossible or unreasonable, he will pay him the value of the benefit.” Section 2 gives the Court discretions with regard to exemption of the” beneficiary from all or part of the duty to make restitution under section 1, if it finds that receipt of the benefit did not involve any loss to the benefactor, or that other circumstances render restitution unjust.”]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

E-Commerce Bill, 2011 
 
[The proposed bill, which was first introduced in its original form in 2008, seeks to regulate e-commerce including the liability of ISPs, introducing a notice and take down safe harbor for ISPs. However, it currently seems as if the implementation prospects of the bill are quite low.]


DECISIONS


Superior Courts

Supreme Court, Civil Appeal 9183/09, The Football Association Premier League Ltd v John Doe (2012)
[copyright, streaming, free speech, tort law, unjust enrichment, contributory liability, intermediary, users’ rights, ISPs]
 
[This case involves unauthorized streaming of live soccer games of the English Premier League. The Supreme Court suggests in dicta several possibilities to further establish Contributory Liability with regard to ISPs. Since no arguments were raised regarding Contributory Liability in this case, the discussion is merely illustrative. In this case the English Premier League requested that an ISP reveal the name of the person who infringed on its copyright. Justice Neal Hendel argued that direct liability against ISPs could be established through the duty of care found under Negligence, but Justice Hanan Melcer argued that Contributory Liability with regard to ISPs should be based on unjust enrichment. The Court concluded that since the argument of Contributory Liability was not raised in this case, no decision will be reached on this issue.]
 
Supreme Court, Civil Appeal 5977/07, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem vs. Schocken Publishing House (2011)
[copyright, textbooks, free speech, tort law, contributory liability, intermediary]
 
[The decision in Hebrew University v. Schocken is considered the leading authority on Contributory Liability in the context of copyright law. In this case, the Supreme Court introduced Contributory Liability doctrine into copyright law. This case involved copying of textbooks. The Israeli Labour Party subsidized a student club called “Teh Ofek” (Horizon Cell) at the Mt. Scopus Campus of Hebrew University. As an incentive to get students involved, they provided cheap versions of a course textbook entitled “Traditional Japan,” the publisher sued the student club, the Labour Party and the University. The Supreme Court has recognized that in certain specific circumstances courts can use the doctrine of Contributory Liability from Tort law to assess whether the action of an intermediary is infringement of copyright. The Court stated that Contributory Liability will be recognized only when three conditions have been met: (i) there was actual direct infringement; (ii) the contributor had actual knowledge of the direct infringement; and (iii) there was substantial, significant and actual contribution by contributor to the infringement. 
 
Supreme Court, Civil Appeal 1636/98, Rav-Bariach Ltd v SDR Ltd, 2001
[patents, contributory liability, intermediary, US patent act]
 
[This is the first case which introduced the doctrine of Contributory Liability into the patent system in Israel, taking inspiration from the Contributory Liability found in the US Patent Act. In a sense this case has established the basis on which Contributory Liability could be more easily introduced into copyright.]
 

Lower Courts


District Court of Tel-Aviv, 49918-05-12, Amir Savir v. Google, July 5, 2015
[defamation, hosting provider, search engine, Google, blog post, tags] 
 
[(1) The case was brought by Ami Savir against the owner of the website court.org.il and Google. Mr. Savir, an Israeli attorney was mischaracterized as having committed five acts of unethical attorney behavior when in fact he only represented the Israel Bar Association in disciplinary proceedings related to the liable attorney. Due to tags added to an original blog post from court.org.il, Google's search algorithm made it appear as if Mr. Savir, rather than the party he repesented, was the attorney who was convicted.
 
(2) The court reversed a magistrate’s preliminary opinion, holding court.org.il liable but not Google, and held that Google must remove search results that are clearly defamatory in nature.] [See also Columbia GFE]
 
District Court of Tel Aviv , Civil Action 37039-05-15, ZIR”A et al. vs. Anonymous, Bezeq Ben Leumi et al., July 1 2015
[copyright, freedom of expression, free flow of information, censorship, privacy, hosting provider, streaming software, access provider, preliminary injunction, contributory liability]
 
[(1) Several content providers sued ISPs to block access to the websites allowing users to download a streaming software called “Popcorn” which allows users to stream video content off the internet by connecting users to allegedly copyrighted content through other sites. The content providers also requested the details of users making use of Popcorn.
 
(2) The court mentioned the UK case about the use of Popcorn software, Twentieth Century Fox Corp. v. Sky  UK  Ltd., [2015] EWHC 1082 (Ch). However, the Court relied on the Israeli Supreme Court Ruling in 4447/07 Rami Mor vs. Barak ITC (1994) Bezeq international, with regard to revealing the indemnity of users of ISP. The Judge ruled that at this stage when the infringement was not proved, and it was not proved that the defendant was liable or has caused damages to plaintiffs there is no room to provide an injunction to the ISPs compelling them to reveal the identities of ISPs users.
 
(3) The Judge differentiated this case from NMC United Entertainment LTD et al. vs. Bloomberg et al. (see below), on several grounds, one of which was the nature of the proceeding in this case, a preliminary injunction, and the nature of the alleged infringement. The Judge added that in this case, the burden on the ISP is much harsher since shutting down a single website is not the same as monitoring and closing each website which enables users to download the Popcorn software. In addition, the Judge noted the risk of asking ISPs to function as internet censors, against the damage to plaintiffs’ copyrights. The Judge noted that when the legal solution of asking ISPs to censor websites is not efficient and there is a risk of hurting the flow of information, without establishing proper scope of operation for the ISPs and without introducing the checks and balances by the legislative branch, then the balance of burden does not allow the court to approve such a preliminary injunction.
 
(4) The Court in addition declined to approve the settlement between the sides, on the grounds that the claims of the users and of the Attorney General of Israel were not submitted to the Court, therefore, he did not approve it as a verdict. 
 
District Court of Tel-Aviv, Civil Ruling 33227-11-13, NMC United Entertainment LTD et al. vs. Bloomberg et al., May 12, 2015
[copyright, hosting provider, access provider, streaming, downloading, unjust enrichment, contributory liability, injunction]
 
[(1) This case involves unauthorized streaming and download of music recordings through the website Unidown. Five Israeli music record companies sued the owners of the website Unidown and several ISPs claiming that the website enables users to listen and download music recording copyrighted by them without authorization. The Website claimed that it merely functions as a “search engine” allowing users to listen to music recordings through youtube.
 
(2) The District Court found that Unidown should be viewed as an infringing platform which enables the unauthorized download of copyrighted works in disguise of a “search engine”. The Judge claimed the problem is not with the technology but with the use been made of it. The court found with regard to the download function of Unidown, that the website enabled users through other websites to download music recordings unauthorized, and therefore, found it guilty of contributory liability to copyright infringement.
 
(3) With regard to the streaming option of Unidown, the Court found that since the website was directly connecting users to youtube, there was no direct infringement by the users and therefore, there cannot be contributory infringement with regard to the streaming option.
 
(4) Since the Judge found Unidown guilty of contributory infringement (for the download function) he does not settle the question of whether embedded links or content the way done by Unidown could give rise to other liability claims such as unjust enrichment or infringement of moral rights, and leaves the question pending.
 
(5) The Judge claims that finding Unidown guilty of copyright infringement enables the Court to order the sued ISPs to block access or take down the Unidown website. In giving his opinion that the Court can order the ISPs to shut down or block access to an infringing websites, the Judge relies among others on a UK verdict, Sea Shepherd UK v. Fish @ Fish Ltd. [2015] UKSC 10 (March 4, 2015). The Court orders the main defendants (the owners of Unidown) to close the website, and orders the ISP hosting the website to block access to the website and pay attorney fees to plaintiffs. In addition, the Court allows the ISP to appeal the order to block the website in case such action will involve high costs.]  
 

District Court of Tel-Aviv, Charlton Ltd. v. Bezeq International & Co., 2014 (PENDING) (official name of case not yet available)
[streaming, sport, contributory liability, ISPs, take down, users’ identities] 
 
[In early April 2014, Charlton Ltd. filed a lawsuit in the Tel-Aviv district court against three major Israeli ISPs. Charlton is arguing that the ISPs have contributory liability with regard to streaming of sports events in which Charlton has copyrights. Charlton argues that the ISPs have the ability to easily monitor and prevent the infringement but choose not to act in that regard. Charlton is asking the court to instruct the ISPs to take down dozens of websites and reveal the identities of many users.]
 
District Court of Tel-Aviv, 10695-09-09, Nav N Go Kft. v. Goltzman, 2011 
[copyright, navigation software, hyperlinks, contributory liability, notice & take down, supervision]  
 
[The district court in Tel-Aviv ruled that the notice and take down procedure does not have a legal standing in Israel, therefore, the argument that the website should have operated on a notice and take down basis is wrong. The Court ruled that in the absence of knowledge, the ability to supervise the information on the website is in itself not sufficient to establish knowledge of infringement. In addition, the website did not fit the two exceptions established in ALIS v. Rotter, encouraging infringement or “forbidden forum”, therefore, the website was not liable under Contributory Liability.] 
 
District Court of Tel-Aviv, 567-08-09, ALIS - Association for the Protection of Cinematic Works v. Rotter.net Ltd., 2011 
[copyright, website, movies, hyperlinks, contributory liability, notice & take down, ISPs]  
 
[Influenced by the Supreme Court’s decision Hebrew University vs. Schocken, the district court in Tel-Aviv. The case involved a website which posted Links to copyrighted works which were posted without authorization. The Court examined the liability of the website for posting only the links and not the actual infringing works. The Court ruled that website could not be held directly liable for posting links to infringing works, as the posting of the links are not infringing on their own, therefore, there is no direct liability. The Court takes into consideration the recent Supreme Court decision Hebrew University vs. Schocken, and rules that in order to establish the element of actual knowledge of the infringement for Contributory Liability, there should be a notice and take down procedure. If intermediary operate a notice and take down procedure they should have a safe harbor against Contributory Liability. The court ruled a website will be found guilty of Contributory Liability only if it was provided a notice and it did not take down the infringing work in due time. The Court further elaborated that there are two cases in which, even without a notice and take down the website will be found guilty of Contributory Liability: i) the website is actively encouraging the infringing activity; ii) the website hosts a “forbidden forum” - a specific forum in a website is dedicated to infringing activity.]

Electronic Transactions Act, 2007
 
[PART VII of the Electronic Transactions Act (§§51-59) deals with ‘Liability of Service Providers’. The statutory provisions generally employ a ‘mere conduit’ approach, and do not require service providers to actively monitor data that is transmitted or stored. However, §53 provides that the service providers only enjoy protection from liability if they are a member of the representative industry body recognized by the Minister, and have adopted and adequately implemented that body’s code of conduct.  As such, the Code of Conduct is hence set by the industry, rather the government. It is not know whether such an industry body has yet been recognized, or if such a code of conduct has been established. Furthermore, a service provider must have a designated agent to deal with notifications of infringement, in order to enjoy liability limitations for data storage (§56). §57 sets out that the Minister is to issue a notification of unlawful activity upon receiving a complaint by a complainant.]

[Part 5 of the Electronic Transactions Act (§43) deals with Intermediaries and Internet Service Providers. The provision is basic and employs a ‘mere conduit’ approach. There is no affirmation of a non-requirement to monitor transmissions, and there is no elaboration on the procedure to be followed when knowledge of potential liability arises. §43 does however allude to procedures required by Regulations, but no such Regulations are known to have yet been passed.]

43,CARICOM,"
Legislation | Bills and Pending Proposals | Decisions | Contributors | Feedback | Return to WILMAP Home Page
Summary: Jurisdictions of the Caribbean Region are generally still in the process of implementing policies for their ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) sectors. On the issue of Intermediary Liability, the States that have passed statutory provisions have done so by including such provisions in their Electronic Transactions Acts (which are meant to primarily deal with the authentication of electronic documents and signatures). In general, where such provisions exist, they are based on the mere conduit principle. However, there are no known instances in any Caribbean jurisdiction where the court has heard a case on intermediary liability. In 2009, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) funded the HIPCAR Project (Enhancing competitiveness in the Caribbean through the harmonization of ICT Policies, Legislation and Regulatory Procedures). The beneficiary countries were the States of CARICOM (the Caribbean Community). This project included an assessment of each beneficiary country’s ICT legislation, including Electronic Transactions, within which the issue of Intermediary Liability was included. The project also resulted in ‘Regional Model Policies and Regulations’. For most Caribbean States with recent legislation, the Electronic Transactions Act (and hence Intermediary Liability) generally resembles this model legislation. For those countries that have not yet passed legislation (or are to consider updating their laws), it can be anticipated that the draft bills will also follow the form of the model legislative texts. The provisions on Intermediary Liability are contained in PART IV (SS26-28) of the model legislative text on Electronic Transactions.

Law No. 20.453, August 26, 2010, establishing the principle of Net Neutrality for consumers and Internet users
 
[In general, this law tackles intermediary non-interference from the perspective of users by adding to the general rules within the General Telecommunications Act (Law Nº 18.168) new rules for internet service providers. Article 24 H states that internet providers (“all natural or legal persons that provide commercial connectivity services between users or its networks and the Internet”): a) shall not block or interfere in any way with the rights of the user to use any content, application or service on the internet; but they may take traffic management measures or block contents upon user requests (and to their cost); b) shall respect device neutrality by not limiting the right to use the internet on any legal device that does not impair use of the net or the quality of service; c) shall offer parental control services; d) shall publish information on their website regarding access characteristics, speed, quality, distinguishment between local and international linking, and service nature and warranties. Articles 24 I and 24 J establish the procedure for sanctions (administrative procedure before the Telecommunications Undersecretariat) and the regulations for minimal information conditions.]
 

Law No. 20.435, May 04, 2010, amending Intellectual Property Law
 
[Together with new copyright exceptions and limitations and the new rules for collecting societies’ tariff procedures, this amendement establishes a regime of limitations on liability for information service providers, as defined in Artice 5 Y. A number of Articles deal specifically with intermediary liability. Article 85 L provides a liability limitation for ISPs as long as they comply with the conditions and requirements of this law, regardless of potential regular civil liability. Article 85 M provides general conditions for limiting liability of transmission, routing, or connection providers that do not modify or select content, or initiate or select the destination of transmissions. Article 85 N provides general conditions for limiting liability among caching service providers that respect access and update conditions, do not interfere with access technology, do not modify content, and remove infringing materials upon legal request. Article 85 Ñ provides general conditions for limiting liability of hosting providers that do not have effective knowledge of infringing data, do not gain direct economic benefit from infringement while having the authority and ability to control it, publicly designate a representative to receive notices, and remove or block content upon legal request. Effective knowledge means an unexecuted and properly notified court order. Article 85 O establishes general conditions to limit liability for all providers except search engines, such having public conditions to enact the right to terminate agreements with repeat infringers, not interfering with TPM or RMI, and not generating or selecting content or receivers of it. Article 85 P establishes no obligation to monitor content for online intermediaries. Art. 85 Q regulates the removal procedure, including the formalities of requests (regular lawsuit requirements, plus rights, contents and URL identification), court order notice, possibility for opposition. Articles 85 R, 85 S and 85 T provide additional procedural rules for removal. Article 85 U provides notice and counter-notice conditions and requirements.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Trans Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Rights Chapter [confidential text leaked on August 30, 2013]
 
[Chile is partecipating in the negotiation of an international agreement including a section on Internet service provider liability, with countries lining up either in favour of a general notification obligation or a notice-and-takedown system with the prospect of terminating subscriber Internet access and content blocking. Chile favors the former approach.] [See M. Geist Blog post]
 
[None was currently under discussion at national level; the next government might send new bills or start new regulations.]
DECISIONS

[After the enactment of Law 20.435 in 2010, there have been no reported cases applying the new legislation to intermediary liability. All cases concerning intermediaries were brought as constitutional claims and resorted to directly on constitutionally recognized rights. Constitutional action is usually presented directly to Courts of Appeals and appealed before the Supreme Court.]
 

Superior Courts

Supreme Court, Suazo vs Reclamos.cl, 2009
[appeal decision, constitutional action, defamatory content]
 
[The plaintiff sought relief from the administrator of a website (www.reclamos.cl) where people can leave anonymous public messages with complaints against companies and services. The plaintiff, the representative of a school, claimed that the site administrator should be held liable for a slanderous accusation posted against her. The plaintiff claimed that the accusations affected her constitutional rights of freedom of teaching and property. A co-plaintiff claimed that his freedom to work was equally affected. The Court of Appeals rejected the claim by recognizing the need to enforce freedom of opinion and freedom of information without prior censorship. Data protection and regulation of journalism were also mentioned by the Court to prevent identification of possible defendants. The Court of Appeals established that providers only fulfill the duty to provide the means of communications. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal, establishing that there was no abusive exercise of the right to express an opinion and inform without prior censorship. The Supreme Court considered that there is no duty of ex ante control by the website administrator.]
 

Lower Courts

Court of  Appeals of Valparaíso, Abbott vs Google, 2012
[constitutional action, defamatory content]
 
[The plaintiff sought an injunction and relief against a series of Chilean websites as well as Google, claiming that the websites, along with blogs hosted by Google, were making slanderous or offensive accusations against the plaintiff, who is a lawyer. These websites claimed that the plaintiff is corrupt and collaborated with the military dictatorship in the second half of the 20th Century. The Court agreed with the plaintiff and ruled that the right to plaintiff’s honour was affected. The Court ordered the websites to remove the offensive content, including blog posts with offensive accusations. Additionally, the Court ordered Google to establish a filtering mechanism that automatically prevents the publication of “unequivocally” slanderous content. The decision was not appealed.]
 

Court of Appeals of Concepción, Fuentes vs Entel II, 2007
[appeal decision, civil action seeking damages for defamatory content]
 
[Plaintiff sought monetary relief from both the internet service provider (Entel) as well as the parent of the person that posted a defamatory content (see below Entel I). The Court recognized the lack of rules for internet content. General damages rules are to be applied. However, the action was rejected. The service provider is not liable under general rules as it could not control the uploaded content. Additionally, the natural person was held not liable as the alleged infringer was already of age.]
 

Court of Appeals of Concepción, Fuentes vs Entel I, 1999
[constitutional action, defamatory content]
 
[Stating that liability for defamatory content - a false offering of sexual services by the minor daughter of plaintiff - may be exclusively casted upon the provider of the content, not the manager of the website or the provider of connection. This decision recognizes the lack of rules for internet content, but it also recognizes that only ex post control over content is possible or to be expected. Upon noticing “evidently” offensive content, providers should take measures to prevent further harm, but they are not liable for damages before that moment. The decision establishes, but does not explain, the principle of “freedom of the information that circulates on the internet”.]

Nigerian Copyright Act, Cap C28, 2004
 
[The Act does not contain provisions specifically dedicated to Internet intermediaries. However, provisions that may be relevant for intermediary liability are listed below. Also, amendments to the law to include intermediary liability provisions are under discussion (see below). 
 

(1) Article 6 provides that copyright infringment can be enforced only through judicial injunctions: ""infringement of copyright shall be actionable at the suite of the owner, assignee or an exclusive licensee of the copyright, as the case may be, in the Federal High Court exercising jurisdiction in the place where the infringement occurred; and in any action for such infringement, all such relief by way of damages, injunction, accounts or otherwise shall be available in any corresponding proceedings in respect of infringement of other proprietary rights.""
 
(2) According to Article 20, ""Any person who-(a) sells or lets hire or for purpose of trade or business, exposes or offers for sale, or hires any infringing copy of any work in which copyright subsists; or (b) distributes for the purposes of trade or business any infringing copy of any such work; or (c) has in his possession other than for his private or domestic use, any infringing copy of any such work, shall, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that he did not know and had no reason to believe that any such copy was not an infringing copy of any such work, be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of an amount not exceeding N 1,000 for every copy dealt with in contravention of this section or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or in the case of an individual to both such fine and imprisonment.""
 
(4) According to Article 21, the Copyright Commission shall have the power to enact regulations or other anti-piracy measures. This power may expand the jurisdiction of the Commission to intermediaries.
 
(3) Article 22(1) provides for the liability of firms or other associations of persons: ""Where an offence under this Act has been committed by a body corporate, the body corporate and every person who at the time the offence was committed was in charge of, or was responsible to the body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of such offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Provided that nothing contained in this subsection shall render any person liable to any punishment, if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Copyright Amendment Bill, An Act to Amend the Copyright Act Cap. C28 Lpn 2004 for the Purposes of Making Provisions for Technological Measures in Protecting Copyright and for Other Related Matters, SB.03, 2011
 
[The Copyright Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Copyright Act of 2004 and focuses primarily on the role of new technologies in the infringement of copyright, with provisions on Internet Service Providers’ (ISPs) liability, including ISPs exemptions for storing infringing material, for caching, a notice and take down regime and a termination for repeated infringers regime. Apparently, the Bill does not include a mere conduit exemption.
 
(1) Section 3 provides that ISPs must have a termination policy for their Internet service subscribers that repeatedly infringe copyright. In particular, the Bill states that: (i) ""An Internet Service Provider must adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides for termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the account with that Internet Service Provider of a repeat infringer""; (ii) ""This provision applies if a person infringes the copyright in a work [ . . . ] without the consent of the Copyright owner."" The Bill does not specify how many times an infringer should violate copyright law to be tagged as a repeated infringer nor provides a right of appeal for people whose access rights are terminated.
 
(2) Section 4 provides for a hosting/storing exemption for ISPs. (i) ISPs are exempted from liability for copyright infringment if they store infringing materials uploaded by a user, unless (a) they know or have reasons to believe that the material infringed copyright in the work, and (b) do not promptly prevent access to the infringing materials as soon as becoming aware of them. (ii) Knowledge of infringment can be proved in court by all relevant means, including whether the Internet Service Provider has received a notice of infringement. (iii) ISPs must promptly give notice to the user that the material has been deleted or access to it prevented.
 
(3) Section 6 provides for a caching exemption for ISPs. As long as ISPs do not modify the material that they store temporarily for the purpose of allowing faster access by users, they are not liable, unless certain conditions apply (6(2)(a)-(c).]
 
Electronic Transaction Bill, An Act to Facilitate Electronic Transactions in Nigeria; and for Related Matters, HB.03, 2011
 
[The Electronic Transaction Bill does specifically focus on internet intermediaries but includes provisions imposing obligations on intermediaries. 
 
(1) Section 16 provides that an accredited certification authority is liable for the certificates it issues especially electronically and therefore responsible for any breach of its obligations: ""An accredited certification authority shall be liable for any breach of its obligations and shall pay fines as may be specified in the specification administration guidelines.
 
(2) Intermediaries may be liable if they do not comply with data protection obligations included in the bill. The ""Data Holder"" is responsible for any damages caused as a result of contravention of any of the requirements in the Act: ""An individual who suffers damage by reason of any contravention by a data holder of any of the requirements of this Act is entitled to compensation from the data holder for that damage."" (Section 21, par. 3). Additionally, the ‘Data Holder’ must implement measures for the security of the data in its possession: ""A data holder must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures and exercise reasonable care to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss and against unauthorized alteration, processing, disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing."" (Section 23, par. 1).]

LEGISLATION

Guatemalan Civil Code, Decree No.106, July, 1964 (Article 1645)

 
[Guatemala does not have any specific legislation regarding Internet Service Providers’ (ISP) liability. However, Guatemalan legislation regarding civil obligation establishes that any harm or damage caused by any person, must be compensated/repaired. Article 1645 of the Guatemalan Civil Code is used as reference for court cases and decisions: “Any person, who causes any damage or prejudice to another person, either intentionally, or by carelessness or negligence, is required to repair it, unless the damage or prejudice are caused by inexcusable negligence, or guilt of the victim, and is so proven.” Since there is no specific legislation regarding damages caused by Internet Service Providers, this article is the main legal source governing intermediary liability in Guatemala. If a user, or an owner of a domain warns the Internet Service Provider that there is a copyright infringement,  the ISP must take down the allegedly infringing information.  If the ISP does not act upon an infringement complaint, they might be responsible for the negligence or carelessness and they are accountable for reliance interest and expectation interest (damages).]
 
Copyright Law, Decree No. 33-89, May 2003
 
[Copyright law would be the legal basis for decisions regarding any case of Internet Service Providers’ (ISP) liability in Guatemala involving infringinment of moral or economic rights belonging to an author. In case of infringement, the rightholder may certainly hold liable the direct infringer uploading the protected materials, but it might also, according to Article 1645 of the Civil Code, establish judicial proceedings against the ISPs if the author can prove negligence or carelessness from their part.]

The Draft Law 241/2011 (see below) was the first attempt of implementing the FTA and only covered  liability exemptions for ISPs.]

[Due to the fact that there is not special law concerning liability of intermediaries on the Internet, the general provisions established in the Civil Code apply to liability of intermediaries. The Colombian legal system does not have notions of contributory or vicarious liability similar to those established in the USA due to its civil law heritage that has different principles concerning third parties liability and tort. The general principle governing third party liability is provided in Article  2341 of the Colombian Civil Code. Article 2341 establishes the following main principle: ""anyone that causes harm to other, shall indemnify"". ]

BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS
Statutory Draft Law No. 119 of 2013 – House of Representatives, October 8, 2013, by which a statute is issued to establish the deactivation of autocomplete function on Internet search engines as long as they make a pejorative and/or undermining reference of the rights of good name, honor, privacy and human dignity of individuals and entities, nationals or internationals, and establishes other provisions.
 
[This bill is currently under discussion. It prohibits the activation of the autocomplete function of search engines to do pejorative and/or undermining reference of the rights of good name, honor, human dignity and privacy of Internet users and non-users. After the promulgation of the law, existing search engines must exclude the pejorative references mentioned (art. 3).] 
 

Draft Law No. 241 of 2011 – Senate, April 4, 2011, by which a statute is issued to regulate copyright and related rights infringement liability on the Internet
 
[This bill was passed in 2011 before the Senate to implement the FTA between Colombia and USA. However, the bill was archived few months later, when it was evident that there was no political willingness to push it through. It featured liability exemptions for Internet Service Providers (art. 4), including mere conduit (art. 5), caching (art. 6), hosting (art. 7), information location tools (search tools, hyperlinks and directories; art. 8) exceptions, for infringements to copyright and related rights by third parties that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by ISPs. Providers of such services will not be required to compensate damages and will not be consider liable as long as they meet the conditions according to the nature of the service provided. These conditions include expedited removal or access disablement as a consequence of a claimed or apparent infringement and the notification to the alleged infringer of the removal or access disablement (art. 9). ISPs are not required to supervise the information they transmit, store or refer, nor they have the obligation of actively seeking facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity (art. 3). As a preliminary remedy, right holders can request an ISP to terminate accounts of repeated infringers (art. 13).]

Constitutional Court, Gloria v. Casa Editorial El Tiempo, T-277/15, May 12, 2013
[defamation, liability, media outlets, search engines]
 
[Stating that when there is a favorable outcome for an individual in a proceeding—in this case Gloria was acquitted from charges of human trafficking—there is an obligation to update the information and make the outdated information unavailable through searches; however, this obligation would apply only to media outlets—el Tiempo in this instance—which should ensure, using available Internet tools, that search engines would be unable to find the article, while ordering Google to block an article linking an individual to human trafficking would amount to a form of prior censorship].
 
Constitutional Court, On behalf of a minor vs. “El nuevo día” newspaper & Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar, Judgment T-453/13, July 15, 2013
[defamation, liability, search engines]
 
[A newspaper published information regarding an allegedly sexually abused minor. The published information, which leaked from governmental institutions, almost revealed the minor's identity completely. The Court confirmed that, by making the information available on the Internet and make it retrivable through search engines, the privacy right of the minor was violated. As in the previous judgment T-040/13 (see below), the Court ruled that Google Colombia was not responsible for the information displayed through the search engine. Instead, liability was to be casted only upon the the newspaper, which collected, analyzed, processed and disseminated the information about the minor.]
 
Constitutional Court, Martínez vs. Google Colombia & El Tiempo publishing house, Judgment T-040/13, January 28, 2013 
[defamation, liability, search engines] 
 
[Court ruled a writ of amparo (“acción de tutela”) regarding the request of a citizen of eliminating an old newspaper article that connected him to a criminal organization and a former criminal process. The article was displayed on Google search engine and a newspaper website. The plaintiff claimed the violation of his fundamental rights of privacy, good name and honor. According to the Court, Google search engine had not published the information and, for that reason, it was not required to modify, correct, delete or supplement the information retrieved in a specific search].

50,Mexico,"Legislation | Bills and Pending Proposals | Decisions | Contributors | Feedback | Return to WILMAP Home Page
 
SUMMARY (provided by Jose Camarena): (1) In Mexico there is no ad hoc legislation, such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The Copyright Law contemplates provisions which accommodate concepts such as fixation, reproduction or communication to the public in the digital environment. The Copyright Law does not make internet service providers (ISPs) liable or provide any safe harbours excluding liability in specific situations like caching, search engine, mere conduit or routing. The exceptions and limitations imposed by the Copyright Law are restrictive in scope and it would be difficult to invoke them in connection with digital rights. The Copyright Law of Mexico does not provide exceptions or limitations to copyright or neighboring rights in connection with the activities of ISPs or other intermediaries. Intermediaries in charge of connecting Internet sites operated by infringers of copyright or neighboring rights, are not clearly liable of infringement, namely indirect infringement, by providing means to the site operators –connecting their sites to an indeterminate number of users, but also providing software that users can employ for file sharing or other purposes- who then perpetrate infringement of rights in a direct fashion. No exception or limitation system can exist in the absence of rights or actions to enforce the same. 
 
(2) Direct infringement has been explored, with success, in connection with works disseminated over the Internet, based on the economic right of access that derives from WIPO Treaties. The access right has been tested in a number of cases related to the film and music industries. The most significant case in Mexico has been MPAA v. SigloX.com. As a result of that case, the site was dismantled, the server seized and one employee convicted.
 
(3) Secondary liability of intermediaries has been debated at a government level, with the participation of groups or association like the Business Software Alliance (BSA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), a number of collecting societies, as well as the largest ISPs in the country, that include Telmex and Telefonica. However, they have not convinced that ISPs can be liable for secondary copyright infringement, because the Copyright Law or international treaties do not deal with the issue. Among the proposals made, a bill was introduced in 2010 adopting a three-strike system and using the French HADOPI 2 as a model.
 
(4) Civil liability tools have been tried. Collective societies have threatened with litigation against ISPs, but not under the provisions contained in the Mexican Copyright Law (because there are none concerning these matters), some of them are instead trying to rely on civil law principles such as subjective liability. However, being civil in nature, it has been questionable whether it can apply to infringement matters deriving from the Copyright Law. Likewise, the civil theory is narrow in scope, and would not easily accommodate to non-common situations dealing with special rights. Moreover, issues like assistance or inducement are additional factors that can complicate the application of civil liability doctrines. For ISPs in Mexico, the balance inclines to their side, taking into account that the Copyright Law does not recognize their liability. Copyright holders cannot invoke any sort of legal actions against intermediaries unless they perform direct infringement. However, as in other jurisdictions, the question remains if it can be justified that intermediaries are held liable of indirect copyright infringement for connecting users, regardless if these latter engage in wrong doing. 
 
(5)  The non contractual theory of strict liability could be a way of proceeding against ISPs but effective results seem unlikely. The concept of 'strict liability' is defined in Article 1913 of the Civil Code in the following manner: ""When a person operates machines, any instrument or substance that is inherently dangerous [ . . . ] such person is obliged to repair the damage caused by such instruments, even if the person does not act in an unlawful manner, unless that person proves that the damage was a consequence of the inexcusable fault or gross negligence of the injured party."" Judicial precedent demonstrates that strict liability is based on a non-contractual theory of liability. Judicial decisions have stated that when a party to an agreement involving 'inherently dangerous' instruments is injured, the basis for imposing strict liability is not found in the agreement itself, but rather in the law. Strict liability will be imposed when dangerous instruments cause damage, regardless of whether a contractual relationship existed between the parties. There are situations in which both contractual liability and strict liability may exist: one cause of action can derive from the breach of the contract, and the other from the use of dangerous instruments. In such a case both causes of action can arise and may be exercised. In comparison, strict liability is closely related to subjective non-contractual liability. In both the damages or injuries are a result of a person's wilful acts. However, under strict liability the person's acts are not actually the source of the liability. Rather, strict liability results from the risk inherent in the use of certain objects. Legal theory classifies this type of liability as 'created risk' liability due to the fact that the person using such objects knows (or should know) the dangers involved in their use. Article 1913 governs only situations in which damages result not from an unlawful act but from a created risk. When the cause of the damages is an unlawful act only, then Article 1910 applies: ""A person, while acting in an unlawful manner or against recognized usage, who causes a harm to a third party is obliged to repair the damage, unless it is established that the damage was derived as a result of the inexcusable fault or the gross negligence of the injured party.""

LEGISLATION


Ley de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión [Broadcasting and Telecommunications Act], July 17, 2014
 
[(1) The Telecommunications Act recently passed in Mexico (on July 17, 2014). Under Article 15, Section LXI, the Telecommunications Federal Institute of Telecommunications (FIT) has the power to order the ‘precautionary suspension of transmission of content’.
 
(2) Further, the new law provides the government with the right to geolocalize any cell phone without a warrant. It also forces Internet Service Providers to save customer data for at least 24 months, and to keep such information available for the security agencies of the Mexican Government. All without judicial authorization. (Articles 189-190)
 
(3) Also, telecoms may be requested to block access to communications by the FIT, if those communications are deemed a threat to “public order and national security"" (Article 190, Section VII).
 
(4) The government argues that it requires exceptional measures to combat crime effectively, especially the phenomenon of kidnapping. But The Telecommunications Act does not establish any caution. Many civil organizations are promoting a campaign before the FIT  to demand said agency to issue a negative opinion on the above mentioned controversial points, so that the law can be properly amended.] [see also EFF page; and Article19 page]
 

Federal Law on Copyright, December 5, 1996, as amended on June 10, 2013
 
[(1) In Mexico there is no ad hoc legislation, such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The Copyright Law contemplates provisions which accommodate concepts such as fixation, reproduction or communication to the public in the digital environment. (2) The Copyright Law does not make internet service providers (ISPs) liable or provide any safe harbours excluding liability in specific situations like caching, search engine, mere conduit or routing. The exceptions and limitations imposed by the Copyright Law are restrictive in scope and it would be difficult to invoke in connection with digital rights. (3) The Copyright Law of Mexico does not provide exceptions or limitations to copyright or neighboring rights in connection with the activities of ISPs or other intermediaries.] 
 
Civil Code, August 31, 1928, as amended on December 24, 2013
 
[The concept of 'strict liability' is defined in Article 1913 of the Civil Code in the following manner: ""When a person operates machines, any instrument or substance that is inherently dangerous [ . . . ] such person is obliged to repair the damage caused by such instruments, even if the person does not act in an unlawful manner, unless that person proves that the damage was a consequence of the inexcusable fault or gross negligence of the injured party."" Article 1913 governs only situations in which damages result not from an unlawful act but from a created risk. When the cause of the damages is an unlawful act only, then Article 1910 applies: ""A person, while acting in an unlawful manner or against recognized usage, who causes a harm to a third party is obliged to repair the damage, unless it is established that the damage was derived as a result of the inexcusable fault or the gross negligence of the injured party.""]
 

Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares [Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties], April 27, 2010
 
[The Law provides a set of rights called “ARCO rights”, that refer to the rights of Access, Rectification, Cancellation and Objection, that data owners can exercise against the processing of their personal data by private parties. In particular,  
 
(1) Article 25 provides that ""the data owner will at all times have the right to cancel his personal data. Cancellation of personal data will lead to a blocking period following which the data will be erased. The data controller may retain data exclusively for purposes pertaining to responsibilities arising from processing. The blocking period will be equal to the limitation period for actions arising from the legal relationship governing processing pursuant to applicable law. [ . . .].""
 
(2) Article 26, however, clarifies that ""[t]he data controller will not be obligated to cancel personal data when: I. It relates to the parties of a private or administrative contract or partnership agreement and is necessary for its performance and enforcement; II. The law requires that it be processed; III. Such action hinders judicial or administrative proceedings relating to tax obligations, investigation and prosecution of crimes, or updating of administrative sanctions; IV. It is necessary to protect the legally protected interests of the data owner; V. It is necessary to carry out an action in the public interest; VI. It is necessary to fulfill an obligation legally undertaken by the data owner, and VII. It is subject to processing for medical diagnosis or prevention or health services management, provided such processing is done by a health professional subject to a duty of secrecy.
 
(3) Article 27 states that ""data owners will, at all times and for any legitimate reason, have the right to object to the processing of their data. Where appropriate, the data controller may not process such data owner's data.""]
 
Regulations to the Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data, December 19, 2011 [The Regulations define the ""Right of Cancellation"" (""cancellation means stopping the processing of personal data by the data controller, starting from their blockage and subsequent supression"") and the ""Exercise of Right of Cancellation"" (""the data subject may request, at any time, that the data controller cancel the personal data when he considers that they are not being processed in accordance with the principles and duties established by the Law and these Regulations. The cancellation shall proceed with respect to all personal data of the data subject contained in a database, or only part thereof, as requested""), and the ""Restrictions on the Exercise of Rights"" (""[t]he exercise of ARCO rights may be restricted for reasons of national security, by laws and regulations of a public policy nature, for reasons of public health and safety, or to protect the rights of third parties in those cases and to the extent contemplated in the laws applicable to the matter, or by a decision of a competent authority well-founded in law and fact""), respectivey in Articles 105, 106 and 88.] 



BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Ley de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión [Telecom Bill], introduced on March 24, 2014
 
[The original Bill, later passed into law as the Telecommunications and Broadcasting Ast (see above), included provisions under which Internet Service Providers may have been requested to block access to certain content, applications, or services by the explicit request of the user, under the orders of an administrative authority, the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (FIT), without a court order, if that content or those applications and services are infringing some norm (Article 143 III). These provisions proved to be extremely controversial and were eliminated.] [see also EFF page]
 
Trans Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Rights Chapter [confidential text leaked on August 30, 2013]
 
[Mexico is partecipating in the negotiation of this international agreement including a section on Internet service provider liability, with countries lining up either in favour of a general notification obligation or a notice-and-takedown system with the prospect of terminating subscriber Internet access and content blocking. Mexico favors the former approach.] [See M. Geist Blog post]
 
Copyright Amendment Bill, implementing a Three Strike System, introduced on April 27, 2010
 
[(1) On April 27, 2010, the Mexican Congress filed and published a bill to amend the Copyright Law based on the HADOPI model. The bill aimed to protect copyrighted works through internet services providers (ISPs) covering access, hosting, and other service operations.  The purpose of the bill is to implement a three-strikes system that resembles HADOPI 2.
 
(2) Rights holders can ask the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI) to request ISPs to render two warnings to users that allegedly infringe copyrights on the Internet. A third strike could be made by requesting injunctive relief (or “preliminary measures”, but it is unclear what court action would follow). ISPs who do not render the warnings are subject to administrative sanctions. This bill requires that ISPs take the high burden of using different measures to detect repeat infringement users. In return, ISPs are entitled to limited liability provided that they fulfill obligations such as: adopting contract termination policies: not interfering with measures holders implement to protect works: not starting content transmissions themselves: and not knowingly providing their services to infringer users. The bill only refers to access services and does not mention host, search engine, caching, nor indicate the limitations.
 
(3) As in France, the Mexican bill has attracted the attention of internet groups, including the Mexican international corporation Carlos Slim’s Telmax. These groups have a draft of a new bill that would change the current bill in power planned for review and discussion by the Chamber of Deputies in September this year.]

Administrative procedures


National Institute for the Access to Information (INAI), Carlos Sánchez de la Peña v. Google México, S. de R.L., PPD.0094/14, January 2015
[privacy, hosting provider, right to be forgotten]
 
[(1) The Mexican National Institute for the Access to Information (INAI) ruled in favor of a transportation magnate, Carlos Sánchez de la Peña, who wanted three links removed from Google search results. The links contained negative comments about the business dealings of Mr. Sánchez’s family—including a government bailout of bad loans. The INAI heard the case after Google Mexico rejected a petition from Mr. Sánchez de la Peña to have the links removed.
 
(2) In his request to INAI, Mr. Sánchez claimed that the three Google links distorted and decontextualized information about his activities as an entrepreneur. Mr. Sánchez de la Peña’s family has owned “Estrella Blanca” bus lines for generations. One of the links directed to an article about a lawsuit against Mr. Sánchez’s father, Salvador Sánchez Alcántara, by shareholders in the bus company. Mr. Sánchez de la Peña is named in the story and the snippet accompanying the link. The article also discusses how the company received millions of dollars in loans from Mexican banks that collapsed during the country’s financial crisis in the mid-1990s. The loans, most of them past-due, were absorbed by Mexico’s bank-bailout fund known as IPAB. 
 
(3) The Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties, provides a set of rights called “ARCO rights”, that refer to the rights of Access, Rectification, Cancellation and Objection, that data owners can exercise against the processing of their personal data by private parties (see above). The Regulations to the Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data further qualify those rights (see above). However, the principle according to which a person can request the cancellation of his personal data is very vague. Also, limitations to said cancellation right seem highly discretionary and vaguely defined under Article 26 of the Law as well as under Article 88 of the Regulations. The INAI commissioners considered that Mr. Sánchez met the privacy-law requirements that allow for the removal of information when its “persistence causes injury” even if the information was lawfully published.
 
(4) Mexico’s data privacy law contains exceptions to Internet privacy rules if the information is in the public interest. The INAI, however, didn’t apply the exception, arguing that Google didn’t claim those exceptions when making its case. 
 
(5) The INAI ordered the removal only from google.com.mx. Mexico’s data privacy law only requires the removal of links from local search engines.
 
(6) Google will be challenging the INAI ruling before the ordinary courts. Google Mexico considers that the INAI decision infringes on the right to access to information and freedom of speech. Free-speech advocates sided with Google Mexico by noting that the INAI ruling would allow politicians and business tycoons to abuse the so-called right to be forgotten by wiping out Internet links that cast them in a negative light. Activists and advocates are warning society about the negative effects of this type of rulings, especially in countries like Mexico, where the independent press and media are still fighting against censorship. The INAI ruling removes pieces of information that are essential for academics, think tanks and critical journalists in their work to hold elusive and criminal government officials accountable for their deeds before Mexican society.]

LEGISLATION


Telemedia Act, February 26, 2007 [English Version]
 
[The Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz, TMG) applies to all providers of electronic information and communication services, such as ISPs, to the extent that they are not providing telecommunications services. The Telemedia Act, which is based on the EU E-Commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EC), lists three types of service providers that are exempted from a potential liability under certain requirements (safe harbors): (1) mere access providers (Section 8 TMG), (2) caching providers (Section 9 TMG), and (3) hosting providers (Section 10 TMG). The Telemedia Act also provides that service providers in the meaning of Sections 8 to 10 are not required to monitor the information transmitted or stored by them or to search for circumstances indicating an illegal activity (Section 7 paragraph 2 TMG).]
 
Civil Code, August 18, 1886 [English Version]
 
[The Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) comprises general regulations civil law provision, e.g. on contract law, tort law and property law. The central provisions which may be applied to intermediaries, are Section 823 and Section 1004 BGB. According to Section 823 BGB, a person who is injured in his or her general right of privacy may claim compensation for the damages suffered. According to Section 1004 BGB, the person affected may bring an action for injunction against an intermediary.]

Coalition Contract, December 16, 2013 [Expansion of Hosting Provider Liability]
 
[After the federal elections in Germany in September 2013, the leaders of the two coalition parties have concluded a non-binding coalition agreement that includes expanded hosting provider liability for online copyright infringement. The agreement says one of the coalition’s aims is to combat mass infringements of copyright and therefore “internet service providers should take more responsibility.” The grand coalition plans to “improve enforcement in particular towards platforms whose business model is mainly based on the infringement of copyright.” To that end, the coalition would like to “ensure that such service providers no longer enjoy the general liability privilege as so-called hosting provider and in particular no longer receive advertising revenues.” However, it is unclear what precisely the grand coalition plans to do.] [See also CIS blog]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], Sixth Civil Section, Jameda, VI ZR 34/15, March 1, 2016
[defamation, hosting provider, review portal, anonymity, monitoring duty]
 
[(1) The court ruled that a “review portal” can be liable for the accuracy of user-generated ratings on their web-page if they do not verify the review upon request. In the given case, an anonymous Internet user evaluated the plaintiff, a dentist, with the equivalent of a D-.  
 
(2) The court made clear that the provider is only liable if it breaches the observation duties of the Stoererhaftung doctrine. However, a provider is obligated to verify the review if the anonymity of its portal makes it difficult for the person affected to directly address the reviewer. This implies the duty to request medical records or prescriptions. Moreover, the provider has to pass on that part of reviwers' personal information which is not privileged under § 12 TMG to the person affected by the review.] [See also CIS blog]

 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, GEMA, I ZR 3/14, November 26, 2015
[copyright, hosting provider, access provider, linking, blocking order]
 

[(1) The Court decided on actions against internet service providers over access to websites linking to copyright infringing material. The collecting rights society GEMA sought to enjoin Deutsche Telekom from providing access to the website ""3dl.am,"" hosting links to files in file repositories such as Netload, Uploaded or Rapidshare, which contain material for which GEMA members own the copyright.
 
(2) According to Article 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive, the Court noted that access providers could be enjoined from providing access to sites hosting or linking to copyright infringing material if they knowingly provided the means to allow the infringement, provided they failed to take reasonable care. Additionally, blocking injunctions were not only permissible when the blocked domain contained exclusively infringing material, but also when the legal material was insubstantial compared to the illegal material.
 
(3) The Court also noted that the fact that it was always technically possible to circumvent blocks did not mean that they were ineffective as such.
 
(4) However, a blocking injunction against an ISP required that the rightholders had first taken steps against the primary infringer, such as the website operator or host provider, and failed to stop the infringement, or it was clear from the outset that there was no likelihood of success at all to prevent the primary infringement.  The rightholders had to take reasonable steps, for example by hiring a private investigator or involving criminal prosecution authorities, to determine the identity and location of the primary infringer. In the case against ""3dl.am"", GEMA obtained an ex parte injunction against the operator of the website which could not be served at the address listed with the domain name registrar. GEMA then sued the host provider, but withdrew the complaint after it became clear that the host provider's address was false, too. According to the Court, GEMA should have made further enquiries and could not go after the access provider merely because the listed addresses of the primary infringers were false.]

 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, Hotelbewertungsportal, I ZR 94/13, March 19, 2015
[defamation, hosting provider, travel agency, rating portal, safe harbor, monitoring duty]
 
[The court ruled that online travel agencies are not liable for the accuracy of user-generated ratings on their web pages. First, anonymous remarks in a review cannot be ascribed to the travel agency, which does not endorse the users' comments. Any informed internet user would reject the idea that booking portals make all the comments their own. Second, there is no direct liability for hosting false comments due to the safeharbor for intermediaries provided by § 10 TMG, which is based on Article 14 of the E-Commerce Directive. The “hosting provider” safe harbor applies because the online travel agency is a “neutral” platform that does not interfere with the user’s communication. Therefore, the Court noted, it is not obliged to fulfill “any unreasonable duties to review,” which could “challenge the entire business model” of the platform operator (the Court specifically referred to Sommer unseres Lebens; Internetversteigerung II; Jugendgefährdende Medien in its ruling). If, however, the booking portal is informed of comments allegedly in violation of unfair competition law, it should promptly remove them to avoid liability.]
 

Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], GEMA v. Rapidshare, I ZR 80/12, August 15, 2013
[copyright; hosting provider; Rapidshare; illegal file sharing; hosting provider]
 
[(1) This case concerns a dispute between the German copyright collecting society, GEMA, and the Swiss-based file-hosting service, RapidShare. GEMA sued RapidShare in Germany, alleging that over 4,800 copyrighted music files were shared via RapidShare without consent from GEMA or the right holders.
 

(2) According to the Court, although RapidShare’s business model is not primarily designed for violating rights, it nevertheless provides incentives to third parties to illegally share copyrighted content. It does so by (i) generating revenues through premium accounts which enhance massive data downloads, rather than on fees for storage space, as it is common for cloud computing; (ii) providing anonymous accounts to its user.; (iii) having an abuse rate of 5 to 6 percent - as acknowledged by Rapidshare - that corresponds to approximately 30,000 infringing acts daily.
 
(3) Therefore, the Court saw fit to impose some additional duties on RapidShare to mitigate infringements.  As the court announced earlier in  ATARI v. RapidShare (see below), RapidShare (and similar file-hosting services) should abide to more stringent monitoring duties.  File-hosting services are now required to actively monitor incoming links to discover copyrighted files as soon as there is a specific reason to do so and to then ensure that these files become inaccessible to the public.  As indicated by the Court, the service provider should use all possible resources - including search engines, Facebook, Twitter or web crawlers - to identify links made accessible to the public by user generated repositories of links.]



 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], Sixth Civil Section, Google Autocomplete, VI ZR 269/12, May 14, 2013
[Personality rights; observation duties; Google; autocomplete function]
 
[The prediction of certain negative terms within the autocomplete function of the Google’s search engine is likely to violate personality rights. Google is not privileged by § 10 TMG because the autocomplete function creates new data out of the behavior of Google users. In this case, Google does not qualify as an intermediary for information but as a creator of content. Yet, there are limits to Google’s liability for violations of personality rights caused by the autocomplete function of its search engine. The autocomplete function is no direct threat to personality rights; it is rather a certain type of user behavior that creates a threat. Therefore, Google does not need to check every suggested term in advance. But Google has to stop the display of specific terms if it has knowledge that the suggested terms violate personality rights. Furthermore Google has to prevent future violations by special observations to protect former victims. The victims’ claim follows from §§ 823, 1004 BGB. Remedies include injunctions and damages.]

 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, Morpheus, I ZR 74/12, November 15, 2012
[Wi-Fi, liability for damages, duty of care, children, parents]
 
[The Court ruled that parents are not liable under parental responsibility laws for damages caused by their children using file sharing devices, if parents duly fulfill their supervisory duties. The parents’ supervisory duties towards their children depend on the childrens’ stage of development, namely their age. Parents generally comply with their supervisory duties, if they point out the legal wrong of copy right infringements on the Internet. The instructions have to take into account the child’s age and capacity of discernment. It is sufficient to instruct a normally developed 13-year-old child that generally obeys rules set by her parents that file sharing is illegal and therefore forbidden. Parents are generally not obliged to implement any technical measures to prevent children from infringing. Furthermore, parents have no obligation to check their childrens' computer regularly or constantly supervise their children. However, such obligation might arise, if there is reasonable suspicion that children are using their Internet access for infringements.]

 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, Sommer unseres Lebens, I ZR 74/12, November 15, 2012
[Wi-Fi, liability for infringement, security measures, injunction, liability for interference]
 
[The Court ruled that whoever uses a Wi-Fi router and does not implement the safety standards against third party usage that are commonly accepted at the time the router is bought, is liable for interferences, if third parties abuse this internet access for copy right infringement. A user of a Wi-Fi router has to comply with commonly accepted safety standards at the time she starts using the router independently from the previous occurrence of infringing acts by third parties. The general burden of proof of the identity of the infringer is on the plaintiff. However, when the defendant alleges that she did not cause the infringement, she bears a duty to disclose the circumstances under which such infringement could occur (note that there is no general duty to disclose material facts/discovery in Germany).]
 

Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], Atari Europe v. Rapidshare, I ZR 18/11, July 12, 2012
[copyright, hosting provider, Rapidshare, illegal file sharing, monitoring obligations]
 
[In this case, RapidShare neglected to check whether certain files violating Atari's copyright over the computer game ""Alone in the dark"" were stored on its servers by other users. The court acknowledged that reviewing every file that is uploaded by a user on the server would render RapidShare file-hosting service’s business impossible. Nevertheless, RapidShare should have checked its servers for similar infringing material stored by other users. Therefore, the Court noted, a hosting provider is not only required to delete files containing copyrighted material as soon as it is notified of a violation by the right holder, but must also take steps to prevent similar infringements by other users in the future.] [See also Husovec]


 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, Jugendgefährdende Medien bei eBay, I ZR 18/04, July 12, 2007
[Protection of minors; eBay; competition law; protection obligations; observation duties]
 
[Even if there is no direct responsibility of intermediaries due to the privilege of § 10 TMG, intermediaries have a duty to prevent others from violating youth protection law and competition law using their platform. This duty for intermediaries to interpose arises from § 3 UWG, and applies when one of his users commits a certain violation by selling goods without consideration of the protection of minors law. An intermediary has to prevent other violations from the same user by increasing observation. The intermediary must prohibit and stop transactions regarding the same product. The possible remedies include injunctions and damages.]
 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], Sixth Civil Section, Katzenfreund, VI ZR 101/06, July 23, 2007 
[discussion forum, hosting, libel, disturbance liability, duty to review]
 
[The Court accepted an injunction against an Internet forum operator whose user was found to commit libel on the service. The court noted that even if the operator did not breach its duty to review, the operator can be subject to injunctions for removal based on disturbance liability.]
 

Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, Internetversteigerung II, I ZR 35/04, April 19, 2007
[discussion forum, hosting, libel, disturbance liability, duty to review]
 
[The Court confirmed that an injunction against a disturber is available when no third party infringement was committed, but is feared. The Court recalled that injunctions should not lead to “any unreasonable duties to review” and should not “challenge the entire business model” of the platform operator. It opined that an implementation of filtering software to flag objectively suspicious offers (e.g. due to low price for a certain keyword), then subsequently reviewed flagged transactions manually by employees, is a reasonable measure to make.]

 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, Internetversteigerung I, I ZR 304/01, March 11, 2004
[auction portals, hosting, trademarks, disturbance liability, duty to review]
 
[Auction portals like eBay are neither direct infringer nor aider and abettor and hence generally does not bear tortious liability for infringing offers of its users. Obligation to remove offers can based only on the disturbance liability and arises when the objected offer was brought to its attention and is “clearly infringing”. This obligation also requires that auction platform takes proactive steps to prevent infringement of that kind from occurring again.]


 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, kurt-biedenkopf.de, I ZR 82/01, February 19, 2004
[domain name authority, protection of names, disturbance liability, duty to review]
 
[The Court confirmed its ambiente.de case holding that same applies even in case of re-registration of the infringing domain names.]
 
Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], First Civil Section, ambiente.de, I ZR 251/99, May 17, 2001
[domain name authority, trademarks, disturbance liability, duty to review]
 
[A domain name authority is neither a direct infringer nor an aider and abettor and hence generally does not bear tortious liability for third party registrations that infringe trademarks rights of others. Obligation to cancel the domain name can be based only on the disturbance liability and arises exceptionally when the objected domain name was brought to its attention and is “unambiguously infringing” or after the court determined it to be infringing.]

 


Lower Courts



Landgericht Heidelberg [District Court of Heidelberg], Civil, 2 O 162/13, December 9, 2014
[privacy, personal data, search engine, google, search results, right to be forgotten, takedown, damages]
 
[The Court to decide whether Google had to remove links to a web page which claimed to “expose” racists, i.e. the plaintiffs. The Court ordered Google to remove the links and awarded damages for the company's failure to remove the links promptly upon notification. The damages occurred because the plaintiff had been laid off after his employer had taken notice of the search results.  Apart from that, the Court follows Bundesgerichtshof [Federal Court of Justice of Germany], Sixth Civil Section, Google Autocomplete, VI ZR 269/12, May 14, 2013 (see above). Furthermore, The Court specifically referred to the Google Spain ruling of the European Court of Justice in its reasoning.]
 
Landgericht Hamburg [District Court of Hamburg], Civil, 324 O 660/12, November 7, 2014
[privacy, personal data, search engine, google, search results, right to be forgotten, takedown]
 
[The plaintiff, an entrepreneur, alleged that the German google-webpage contained a “snippet” from a third-party’s blog which suggested that the plaintiff had owned a brothel. In German legal language, a “snippet” is the text below the Hyperlink and the URL on the search engine results page displayed by Google, which “quotes” a part of the linked web page. The court ruled that this “snippet” is an expression of Google, therefore Google was liable for that otherwise third-party content.]
 
Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart [Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart], Civil, Wikimedia, 4 U 78/13, October 2, 2013
[defamation, service provider, hosting provider, Wikimedia, Wikipedia, user-generated content, monitoring]
 
[The plaintiff, a TV station owner, alleged that the German-language Wikipedia article about him contained inaccurate information. The Court ruled that Wikimedia is a “service provider” and not a “content provider.” As a service provider, the German Court declared, Wikimedia is not liable for user-generated content, nor should proactively check Wikipedia entries for allegedly illegal or inaccurate content. Furthermore, because it is a service provider, the Wikimedia Foundation may not be held liable for financial damages. If, however, the Wikimedia Foundation is informed of certain content allegedly in violation of local law, according to the court, that content should be removed to maintain immunity from liability.] [See also Wikimedia Blog post for a summary of the decision in English.]

LEGISLATION

Argentine Civil Code, September, 1871 (articles 1109 and 1113 as modified by Law 17.711 of July 1, 1968)
 
[Although Argentina does not have any specific legislation regarding Internet Service Providers’ (ISP) liability, Articles 1.109 and 1.113 of the Argentine Civil Code are used as references for court cases and decisions: (1) Article 1.109. Any person performing an act, which through his fault or negligence causes damage to another, is obliged to repair the damage. This obligation is governed by the same provisions to which the offenses of the civil law are subject. (2) Article 1.113: The obligation of anyone who causes damage extends to any damage caused by those who are under his/her control or by the things used or under his/her control. In cases of damages caused by things, to avoid liability the owner or custodian must evidence that he has not acted with fault or negligence. However, If the damage is caused by a risky thing or by a defect in the thing, to avoid liability the owner or custodian must evidence the fault or negligence of the victim. (Paragraph incorporated by Article 1, Law No. 17.711 B.O. 26/4/1968). If the thing is used against the explicit will or assumed will of the owner or guardian, he or she will not be responsible. (Paragraph introduced by art. 1, Law N° 17.711 B.O. 26/4/1968)].
 

Intellectual Property Law N. 11.723, September 26, 1933
 
[A number of the judicial decisions regarding intermediary responsibility are based on Intellectual Property Law 11.723. The following articles have been repetedly applied in decisions dealing with intermediary liability: (1) Article 9: No one has the right to publish, without permission from the authors or copyright owners, a scientific, literary, artistic or musical production that has been noted or copied during the private or public reading, execution, or exposition. (2) Article 13: All of the provisions of this law, except those of Article 57, are equally applicable to scientific, artistic and literary works, published in foreign countries, regardless of the author’s nationality, as long as these authors belong to nations that recognize the right to intellectual poperty. (3) Article 71: Whoever defrauds the intellectual property rights bestowed by this law will be sanctioned with the penalty established in Article 172 of the Penal Code (""imprisonment ranging from 1 month to 6 years.’’) (4) Article 72: Without violating the general provisions of the previous article, special cases of fraud will be considered and penalized, in addition to the confiscation of the illicit edition for: a) Whoever edits, sells, or reproduces any means or instrument, a work yet to be published or published without the author’s authorization or rightful claim. (5) Article 79: Prior to interested parties’ guarantee, judges are able to preventively decree the suspension of the performance of a theatre, cinema, philharmonic or other similar piece. There will be a hold on the denounced works, or product, fitting into the aforementioned categories, and whatever measure must be taken to effectively protect the rights of those guarded by this Law].
BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

Legislative Proposal, 8070-D-2012, November 15, 2012, Intermediary Services on the Internet. Providers’ Responsibility Guidelines
 
[Proposing that ISPs should not be liable for the transmitted information, unless they originally transmitted it or modified it. Defines caching, hosting and discusses the dissemination of preventive policies to be made known amongst all users using the host].
 
Legislative Proposal, 2668-D-2012, May 2, 2012, ISPs Responsibility Guideline 
 
[Article 1.1 defines Internet Service Providers (ISP) as the technological intermediaries who allow access, connection and interconnection to networks and data on the Internet. This also includes those spaces that save and publish data. Article 2.3 clearly outlines ISPs' liability and states that ISPs that serve as technical intermediaries will not be held responsible for content originating from a third party, even if they are distributed through that ISP. The content, however, cannot be altered by the ISP, which cannot choose the contents' destination]. 
DECISIONS


Superior Courts

Corte Suprema [Supreme Court], Civil, Rodriguez M. Belen c/Google y Otro s/ daños y perjuicios,  R.522.XLIX., October 29, 2014
[copyright, publicity right, privacy, freedom of expression, search engines, Google, Yahoo, linking, notice, take down, filtering thumbnails]
 
[The case discussed the question whether search engines are liable for linking in search results to third-party content that violates fundamental rights or infringes copyright. The decision was largely favorable to search engines. The Court (1) repudiated a strict liability standard and adopted a test based on actual knowledge and negligence; (2) requested judicial review for issuing a notice to take down content (except in a few cases of ""gross and manifest harm""); (3) rejected any filtering obligation to prevent infringing links from appearing in the future;  and, finally, (4) construed Google Image thumbnails as links and not Google’s own content.] [See also CIS Blog]
 
Corte Suprema [Supreme Court], Civil, Sujarchuk Ariel Bernardo c/Warley Jorge Alberto, S.755, L.XLVI, June 26, 2012 
[freedom of speech, freedom of expression, slander, inadmissibility of damages] 
 
[The civil court charged a journalist for describing Ariel Bernardo Sujarchuk, sub secretary at the University of Buenos Aires, as sinister in a published blog. The Supreme Court applied a known doctrine - The Campillay doctrine - determining that a journalist or, a publisher is not liable for the content published if he or she clearly mentioned the source from which the content is taken, while also not having contributed substantially to the content that was published. In the end, the Court revoked the sentence condemning the journalist].

 

Cámara Nacional de Apelaciones en lo Civil de la Capital Federal [National Civil Court of Appeals, Buenos Aires capital District], Civil, S. M., M. S. c/ Yahoo de Argentina SRL y Otro s/ daños y perjuicios, Expte. Nº 89.007/2006; Cita Online: AR/JUR/XXXXX/2013, November 6, 2013 
[copyright, publicity right, privacy, freedom of expression, search engines, linking, blocking order ]
 
[This case is one among numerous civil lawsuits brought against the search engines Google and Yahoo! by different ‘celebrities’ and well‐known public figures for violation of their honor and privacy (see below Rodriguez and Da Cuhna for more background information). In this case, the court found search engines strictly liable under Article 1113 of the Civil Code, which imposes liability, regardless of knowledge or intention, to those performing risky acts (e.g. indexing third party content creating wider audiences for illegitimate content) or serving as the “guardians” of the thing that generates the damage (e.g. the search engine’s software).]
 
Cámara Nacional de Apelaciones en lo Criminal y Correccional de la Capital Federal [National Court of Criminal Appeals, Buenos Aires capital District], Criminal, “P., L. y otros”, October 28, 2013
[copyright, criminal infringement, YouTube, movies]
 
[Confirmed the previous decision regarding a criminal lawsuit against 10 YouTube users accused of publishing a movie on the platform and infringing copyright law, in particular Article 71 of Law 11.723. The final decision concluded that contents that are uploaded on YouTube are not known in advance by the site administrators who, therefore, do not act as ""guarantors"" of the content and/or neccessarily partecipate in possible illegal actions. According to the ruling, YouTube is an intermediary enjoing a special contition due to its essential character of being a platform to share cultural information globally. The Court concluded that the inherent potential risks of this activity must be balanced with the benefits in terms of the dissemination of cultural content. It also noted that users uploading videos do not infringe Article 71 of Law 11.723 as there was no evidence that there is an economic benefit in favor of the uploader or third parties, generated by trick or deception, and the victims did not experience any direct damage].
 
Cámara Nacional de Apelaciones en lo Civil de la Capital Federal [National Civil Court of Appeals, Buenos Aires capital District], Civil, María Belén c/ Google Inc. y Otro s/ Daños y Perjuicios, Expte. Nº 99.613/06; Cita Online: AR/JUR/21886/2013, May 13, 2013 
[blocking order, linking]
 

[This case is one among other civil lawsuits brought against the search engines Google and Yahoo! by different ‘celebrities’ and well‐known public figures for violation of their honor and privacy (see below Da Cuhna for more background information). The plaintiff, a former model, sought an order requiring Google and Yahoo to: (i) permanently block from the search results the links to webpages displaying prostitution ads and pornography whenever they included her name or images, which allegedly violated her constitutional rights; (ii) stop any commercial unauthorized use of her image and name, which allegedly infringed her publicity right and, (iii) pay damages. 
 
(1) Specifically, the Court of Appeals first decided that strict liability is not compatible with freedom of expression and rejected the plaintiff’s request to apply strict liability.
 
(2) Second, Argentina’s doctrine for press media liability - under which the press are not liable for damages unless they fail to cite sources (“Campillay” doctrine) or act with some sort of bad intent (also known as the “real malice” doctrine) - is not necessarily applicable to other modes of expression. 
 
(3) Third, the Court of Appeals applied the negligence standard to search engines linking to third parties’ content in search results. The Court created a test under which search engines will not be liable, if (i) content is produced by a third party; (ii) the claimant notifies the search engine, identifying the alleged infringing content; and (iii) the search engine acts expeditiously to block the content via some “quick and effective filtering method.”
 
(4) Finally, the appellate court considered image “thumbnails” displayed in search’s results as “Google’s own content”. These, therefore, fail the first prong of the new negligence test. No fair use defense is available under Argentinean law. Thus, Google must pay damages caused by the thumbnails, including, both for copyright and non-copyright claims, actual and moral damages, but not statutory damages, which are unavailable in the Argentinean legal system.]
 

[Appeal to this decision is now pending before the National Supreme Court of Justice. In contrast to the Court of Appeals, the Advocate General, who represents the public interest and submits non-binding opinions prior to a Supreme Court decision, sustained that the ""Campillay"" and the ""real malice"" doctines should be applied to this case (see above).] [See also CIS Blog post reporting on the case and the hearing before the Supreme Court].

[copyright infringement, blocking order, illegal movie streaming]
 
[The website Cuevana, active since 2009, provides streaming links to several movies and TV series. HBO Ole Partners requested to completely block the website for a copyright law violation in connection with the Epitafios TV series. The plaintiff's request, based on Article 13 of the Copyright Law, was rejected by the Appelate Court in February 2013. The Court argued that such a measure seemed excessive and disproportionate. Copyright enforcement, the Court noted, must be balanced with regard to the protection of other fundamental rights of the persons affected by such measures. The ruling also indicates that it has yet to be determined if Cuevana is a website that just provides links or has an index of links leading to content which individual users are responsible for, or there are specific people designated to controlling the content. Additionally, since the identity of the administrators is ignored, the decision indicates that it has not been duly determined who should have been held liable as another reason supporting the inappropriatmess of the decision. Since this is a decision dealing with a preliminary injunction, these determinations are left to the Court deciding on the merits of the case].
 
Cámara Nacional de Apelaciones en lo Civil de la Capital Federal [National Civil Court of Appeals, Buenos Aires capital District], Civil, C. E. M. Y OTRO C/Mercado Libre S. A. S/ DAÑOS Y PERJUICIOS, Expte. Nº 36440/2010 Cita Online: AA83B9, October 5, 2012
[intermediary liability, online market, cunterfeit merchandise]
 
[Individuals sued Mercado Libre after having bought counterfeit tickets on their website. Mercado Libre functions as an online platform which provides a space for sellers to advertise and sell their merchandise and for potential buyers to navigate and shop as desired. Similar to ebay, MercadoLibre serves as a mediator, effectuating limited supervision on individual transactions. Due to the fact that Mercado Libre makes a profit, not only from the space it provides to sellers, but also from each transaction, the National Civil Court of Appeals found it appropriate to apply Argentina’s Consumer Protection Law. Furthermore, Mercado Libre has the responsibility of seeing the transaction through until the buyers receive the merchandise they rightfully purchased. Therefore, Mercado Libre was found guilty alongside with the sellers of the counterfeit merchandise. Mercado Libre appealed the decision, bringing the case before the Supreme Court, which rejected the appeal in November 2013].
 
Cámara Nacional de Apelaciones en lo Civil de la Capital Federal [National Civil Court of Appeals, Buenos Aires capital District], Civil, Da Cunha, Virginia c. Yahoo de Argentina S.R.L. and Google, Expte. Nº 99.620/2006; Cita Online: AR/JUR/40066/2010, August 10, 2010 
[blocking order, linking] 
 
[In Argentina, controversies against the search engines Google and Yahoo! arose in civil lawsuits brought by different ‘celebrities’ and well‐known public figures for violation of their honor and privacy, or for unauthorized use of their names and images on websites with sexual or pornographic content or with offers of sexual services. Da Cunha is just a sample of over a hundred decisions that all apply very similar arguments to very similar fact patterns: a plaintiff who is famous or well-known had his or her image used without authorization by potentially offensive websites operated by third parties unaffiliated with Google and Yahoo. These operators were not named as parties to the lawsuits. Rather, the plaintiffs brought suits against the search engines for facilitating access to the unauthorized content. The National Court of Appeals has applied Article 1109 of the Argentinean Civil Code, analyzing the conduct of the search engine and considering that a search engine could be held liable for third party content when it becomes aware of the infringing content and does not remove it.] 
 
[Appeal to this decision is now pending before the National Supreme Court of Justice. Da Cunha appealed the portion of the Appelate Court's decision stating that the ISP can only be held liable after having received a complaint. The Attorney General of the Nation sustained in an official opinion that the so-called Campillay doctrine should be applied to this case (see above). The Attorney General added that carrying out Da Cunha’s request would be a prior restraint to speech, which is illegal].
 
Cámara Nacional de Apelaciones en lo Civil de la Capital Federal [National Civil Court of Appeals, Buenos Aires capital District], Civil, Bluvol, Esteban Carlos c / Google Inc. y otros s/ daños y perjuicios , Exp. N° 59.532/2009, Cita Online: AR/JUR/55851/2009, September 29, 2009 
[libel and slander, subjective liability]
 
[In the Bluvol case, the plaintiff came to know of a blog on Blogspot, which he had not created, but was posted under his name.  This blog was easily accessible by searching the plainftiff's name on Google. Bluvol argued that the information found on this blog was false and affected his personal and professional life. The court of first instance ruled in Bluvol's favour, requiring the search engines to compensate Bluvol. The judge based his decision on the fact that Google's liability was objective. The Appelate Court sustained that the attributing factor was not objective, since the objective liability of search engines would always lead them to be liable, regardless of their conduct. Moreover, it emphasized that search engines do not create the content. They provide users with tools to access and find it. The Appelate Court applied subjective liability as privided by Article 1109 of the Argentinean Civil Code. The Court analyzed the conduct of search engines and considered that a search engine could be found liable for third party content only if it has ‘‘actual knowledge’’ of the infringing content and fails to remove it. Particularly in the Bluvol case, Google took action only two months after the claim and was therefore found negligent].

[The Pirate Bay, torrent, linking, copyright, blocking order]
 
[The District Court No. 64 in Buenos Aires issued an injunction to block access to the Pirate Bay website in a case initiated by the Argentine Chamber of Phonographic Producers. This is a so called ""autosatisfactive""  injunction that does not need any further determination of the merits of the case. Therefore, the decision is final unless appealed. Later, the Argentine National Communications Commission (NCC) ordered Internet Service Providers to implement the district's court injunction and block access to The Pirate Bay IP numbers and DSN domains in the country within five days.] [See also CIS bolg post]

[linking, copyright, blocking order]
 
[On November 2011, following a claim from Imagen Satelital S.A., a judge ordered ISPs to block access, for all Internet users, to specific content on the website “Cuevana,"" including the TV series ‘'Falling Skies’’, ‘’Bric’’, and ‘’26 people to save the world’’. The blocking order was based specifically on Article 79 of the Copyright Law. The National Commission of Communications implemented the judicial decision and ordered the ISPs to block access to the infringing content].

[linking, blocking order, defamation]
 
[The Argentine Delegation of Israeli Associations (DAIA) requested that Google removed the links to many websites presenting ostensibly anti-Semitic and discriminatory content. DAIA filed a class action and the judge ordered Google to remove links to almost 80 websites including references to negations of the Holocaust and criticism of Israel. The judge acknowledged that such a broad restriction may be considered prior censorship under Argentine Constitutional Law but argued that this prior restriction is allowed when the content being banned is illegal and offensive].

Appellate Courts

Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt) ‘The Pirate Bay case’ RH 2013:27, 26 November 2010 (Swedish only)
[copyright, infringement, torrent, ThePirateBay, linking, jurisdiction]
 
[(1) Importantly this case tested the scope of the protection afforded to intermediaries under the E-Commerce Directive as implemented into Swedish law. The Court concluded that, due to the nature of its operation, The Pirate Bay could not rely on the protection afforded to some intermediaries under the E-Commerce Directive.
 
(2) The case, is also interesting as it considered whether a Swedish court could claim jurisdiction where part of the relevant conduct, in a copyright violation, had taken place abroad. It was clear that some of The Pirate Bay’s users (i.e. the ones committing the actual copyright infringements – the principal offense) were located outside Sweden at the time of committing the copyright infringements. The relevant law makes clear that an offense is regarded as committed where the criminal act took place as well as where the offense was competed (Chapter 2, section 4 Criminal Code). Thus, the courts had to decide where the principal offense was committed when The Pirate Bay’s users were located outside Sweden at the time of committing the copyright infringements. Had the Court concluded that the principal offenses in such cases had been committed outside Sweden, Swedish jurisdiction could be called into question and the application of Swedish law may not have been permitted. However, the District Court stated that: “According to the District Court, there are strong reasons to take the view that an offense that means that one makes accessible something via the Internet is committed in a country where an Internet user may access the information that is made available, provided that the making available has a effect on the legal rights held in that country [...]. This is particularly so where the information – as in this case – is published in a language spoken in that country. This suggests that all of the principal offenses, including those committed by persons located outside Sweden, shall be regarded as committed in Sweden, This conclusion is further supported by the fact that servers (computers) that have hosted The Pirate Bay website and tracker have been located in Sweden.” The Court of Appeal took a slightly more sophisticated approach discussing the matter at greater length but reached a similar conclusion since the torrent files were placed on servers in Sweden.]

LEGISLATION


Federal Act governing certain legal aspects of electronic commercial and legal transactions (E-Commerce Act) [E-Commerce-Gesetz] (ECG), January 1, 2002
 
[The safe harbors for intermediaries of the E-Commerce Directive are incorporated into Austrian national law by the E-Commerce-Act (E-Commerce-Gesetz - ECG). Section V of this act deals with the exclusion of liability for mere access providers (Section 13), search engine services (Section 14), caching providers (Section 15), hosting providers (Section 16) and link providers (Section 17).] [See also IRIS 2002-3:12/22.]
 
Copyright Act [Urheberrechtsgesetz] (UrhG), 1936
 
[According to Section 81 (1a) of the Copyright Act (Urheberrechtsgesetz – UrhG), the intermediary can be sued for injunctive relief. However, if the safe harbors of the §§ 13 - 17 ECG apply, only after the right holder has informed him of the infringement in a cease and desist letter.]
 
General Civil Code [Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch] (ABGB), 1811
 
[ABGB does not have a central provision concerning liability for intermediaries. According to Section 1295 a person can be held liable for damages caused unlawfully through a fault of his. According to Section 1301 everyone who contributes to the damage either directly or indirectly can be held liable. This includes everyone with a certain obligation to prevent the damage from arising, if they have not done so. This liability presumes that the intermediary knew about the infringement or violated a special obligation to test if the infringement occurred. Therefore an intermediary can be held liable for the infringement of personality rights by a blog post or comments under a newspaper article (Section 1330 ABGB) if the plaintiff has informed him of the infringing content and he has refused to block it.]
 
Criminal Code [Strafgesetzbuch] (StGB), 1975
 
[Under certain circumstances the intermediary can be criminally responsible as a coperpertrator. The criminal responsibility of coperpertrators is specified in the Austrian Criminal Code (StGB). The code affirms that persons who knowingly and willingly contribute to a criminal activity (Section 12) can be held criminally responsible. This requires an active contribution which exceeds the safe harbors of the Sections 13 – 17 ECG. See below Regional Criminal Court in Graz] 


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

[There are currently no known new legislative proposals on the issue of intermediary liability.] 

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court), 4 Ob 140/14p, October 21, 2014
[copyright, hosting provider, injunctive relief, cease and desist letter]
 
[(1) The defendant maintains an Internet media website where users can upload content if they have an account and are logged in. The general terms and conditions of the website only allow  content which does not infringe upon the rights of its authors. The claimant holds the rights to certain photographs which users uploaded to the defendant's website. The right holder sued the defendant for publishing the photographs without consent.
 
(2) The Court ruled that a hosting provider can be sued for injunctive relief only after the claimant has informed him of the infringement. However, this prerequisite is not of formal, but of material character. Therefore, the claimant can bring action against the hosting provider but he will not succeed. The cease and desist letter has to contain specific information about the infringement and provide enough evidence of the existence of the copyright. In this case the right holder only sent an invoice, which the Court deemed insufficient.
 
(3) However, if the claimant provides enough evidence of his copyright and specific information about the infringement during the proceedings, the hosting provider cannot continue to plead lack of knowledge about the infringement.]
 
Oberster Gerichtshof, 6 Ob 133/13x, January 23, 2014 (later confirmed in 6 Ob 188/14m, December 15, 2014 and 6 Ob 145/14p, February 19, 2015)
[personality rights, defamation, online newspaper, publisher, disclosure of user data, journalist confidentiality]
 
[(1) An Austrian politician sued the publisher of an online newspaper for disclosure of the names and email addresses of users who posted allegedly infringing comments in the discussion forum under a certain article about the politician.
 
(2) The Court confirmed that the defendant was obliged to disclose the information about the users according to Section 18 (4) ECG. The plaintiff did not have to prove that the comments were infringing. He only had to show probable cause why the comments were infringing. Further the Court ruled that the protection of sources due to journalist confidentiality in Section 31 Mediengesetz (Media act) was not applicable.]
 
Oberster Gerichtshof, UPC Telekabel, 4 Ob 6/12d, May 11, 2012
[copyright, access provider, hosting provider, illegal movie streaming, blocking order, measures adopted]
 


[(1) UPC Telekabel appealed on a point of law to the Supreme Court a decision form a lower court ordering Telekable to block access to an illegal movie streaming website (see below).
 
(2) In support of its appeal, UPC Telekabel submited inter alia that its services could not be considered to be used to infringe a copyright or related right within the meaning of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 because it did not have any business relationship with the operators of the website at issue and it was not established that its own customers acted unlawfully. In any event, UPC Telekabel claims that the various blocking measures which may be introduced can all be technically circumvented and that some of them are excessively costly.
 
(3) The Court decided to stay the proceedings and to refer questions to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.]


 
Oberster Gerichtshof, 6 Ob 178/04a, December 21, 2006
[personality rights, hosting provider, injunctive relief]
 
[The claimant sued the hosting provider for damage allegedly caused by the users of an online guest book which the defendant operates. The Court stated that a hosting provider is excluded from direct civil or criminal liability. However, he is not excluded from civil injunctive relief which exists regardless of culpability.]
 
Oberster Gerichtshof, Google AdWords, 4 Ob 194/05s, December 19, 2005
[search engine provider liability, keyword advertising]
 
[(1) A pharmaceutical company is the holder of a registered trademark 'Glucochondrin'. A third party has used the word 'glucochondrin' for the purposes of keyword advertising in Google Adwords. The trademark holder sued Google for the trademark infringement.
 
(2) The Court ruled that the operator of a search engine cannot be held liable for trade mark infringement by a third party using its keyword advertising tool if the infringement is not apparent to a ‘legal layman’ and if the operator hadn’t been informed of the infringement.]
 
Oberster Gerichtshof, 6 Ob 190/03i, February 19, 2004
[personality rights, hosting provider, onine newspaper, injunctive relief]
 
[(1) An Austrian Bishop claimed that an online newspaper article infringed his personality rights. He sued the newspaper publisher for injunctive relief. The defendant claimed that he is not a hosting provider and therefore cannot be sued for injunctive relief.
 
(2) Due to the defendant's misconception about the interpretation of Section 16 ECG, the Court had to point out that Section 16 ECG does not establish the liability of hosting providers, but rather determines the conditions under which they are not liable for the actions of third parties. The Court also pointed out that hosting providers can be sued for injunctive relief (Section 19 ECG) regardless of Sections 13-17 ECG.
 
Oberster Gerichtshof, fpo.at II, 4 Ob 176/01p, September 12, 2001
[domain name infringement, domain name authority, injunction]
 
[In the second decision regarding the domain www.fpo.at, the Court decided that the domain name authority is obliged to block the domain when the infringement of someone’s right is apparent to a 'legal layman'.]
 
Oberster Gerichtshof, fpo.at I, 4 Ob 166/00s, September 13, 2000 
[domain name infringement, domain name authority, liability, injunction]
 
[(1) The Austrian political party FPÖ operates the website www.fpoe.at. It alleged that the operator of the domain www.fpo.at infringed its name rights because his site contained content similar to the official website of the party and was designed to mislead the visitors of the site into thinking it is the official website of the party.
 
(2) The Court denied the domain name authority’s obligation to monitor all assigned domain names for an infringement. It also ruled that the deletion of a domain name cannot be the subject of temporary injunction.]
 


Lower Courts

Austrian Regional Criminal Court in Graz [Landesgericht für Strafsachen in Graz], July 2014
[child pornography, TOR exit node, coperpretator]
 
[finding the operator of a TOR exit node guilty of willingly contributing to distribution of child pornography under the Austrian Criminal Code. For more information see Husovec.]
 
Oberlandesgericht Wien [Higher Regional Court, Vienna], UPC Telekabel, October 27, 2011
[copyright, access provider, hosting provider, illegal movie streaming, blocking order, measures adopted]
 
[(1) The Court, as an appeal court, partially reversed the order of the court of first instance (see below) in so far as it had wrongly specified the means that UPC Telekabel had to introduce in order to block the website at issue and thus execute the injunction. 
 
(2) In order to reach that conclusion, the Oberlandesgericht Wien first of all held that Article 81(1a) of the UrhG must be interpreted in the light of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29. 
 
(3) It then held that, by giving its customers access to content illegally placed online, UPC Telekabel had to be regarded as an intermediary whose services were used to infringe a right related to copyright, with the result that Constantin Film and Wega were entitled to request that an injunction be issued against UPC Telekabel. 
 
(4) However, as regards the protection of copyright, the Oberlandesgericht Wien held that UPC Telekabel could only be required, in the form of an obligation to achieve a particular result, to forbid its customers access to the website at issue, but that it had to remain free to decide the means to be used.]
 
Handelsgericht Wien [Commercial Court, Vienna], UPC Telekabel, May 13, 2011 
[copyright, access provider, hosting provider, illegal movie streaming, blocking order, measures adopted]
 
[(1) Having established that a website was offering, without their agreement, either a download or ‘streaming’ of some of the films which they had produced, Constantin Film and Wega, two film production companies, referred the matter to the court responsible for hearing applications for interim measures to obtain, on the basis of Article 81(1a) of the UrhG, an order enjoining UPC Telekabel, an internet service provider, to block the access of its customers to the website at issue, inasmuch as that site makes available to the public, without their consent, cinematographic works over which they hold a right related to copyright.
 
(2) The Court prohibited UPC Telekabel from providing its customers with access to the website at issue; that prohibition was to be carried out in particular by blocking that site’s domain name and current IP (‘Internet Protocol’) address and any other IP address of that site of which UPC Telekabel might be aware. 
 
(3) In June 2011, the website at issue ceased its activity following an action of the German police forces against its operators.]
 
Oberlandesgericht Wien, eBay, 1 R 182/10g, September 27, 2010 
[fraud, hosting provider, online auction provider, direct liability]
 
[(1) The plaintiff bought gold on eBay from a seller who had the status of a Power Seller. The Power Seller status is awarded by eBay to sellers who achieve a certain sales volume and who have high ratings. The status therefore improves the credibility of the seller. In this case the seller sold gold which he never delivered. He has been convicted of fraud in 113 similar cases.
 
(2) The Court ruled that eBay was obliged to block the seller who has infringed on eBay's own terms of service. Failing to do so resulted in direct liability for the damage which the buyers, who trusted the credibility of a Power Seller, suffered.]

LEGISLATION


Copyright (Amendment) Act 2014, An Act to Amend the Copyright Act (Chapter 63 of the 2006 Revised Edition), July 2014
 
[(1) The Singapore Paliament passed an anti-piracy amendment to the Copyright Act, which will enter into force at the end of August 2014, to allow right holders to apply directly to the courts for injunctions against Internet Service Providers to prevent users from accessing the so-called “pirate sites” without having to first establish ISPs’ liability for copyright infringement. The new bill provides copyright holders with an express lane to take down the content or block the hosting site within eight weeks, if the High Court signals a green light.
 
(2) The so-called “pirated sites”, known in the proposal as “flagrantly infringing online location”, are to be assessed by the courts based on certain non-exhaustive factors, including (i) whether the online location’s primary purpose is to commit or facilitate copyright infringement, (ii) whether it makes available or contains directories, indexes or categories of the “means to commit copyright infringement”, (iii) whether the owner of the location “demonstrates a disregard for copyright”, (iv) whether the location has been disabled by court orders from other countries on grounds of copyright infringement, (v) whether the location contains guides or instructions on circumventing measures to disable access to the location, and (vi) the number of visitors to the online location.
 
(3) The injunction is permanent, although site owners, ISPs or right holders can apply to the courts to overturn the injunction. Applicants to an existing injunction can more easily apply for another injunction or vary the original injunction in relation to the location that has assumed a different IP address or URL.]
 
Personal Data Protection Act 2012, Act No. 26 of 2012, November 20, 2012 (An Act to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations, and to establish the Personal Data Protection Commission and Do Not Call Register and to provide for their administration, and for matters connected therewith, and to make related and consequential amendments to various other Acts. Among others, it sets out provisions to deal with the liability of “data intermediaries” in relation to their processing of personal data)
 
[Singapore introduced its first comprehensive data protection legislation in the form of the Personal Data Protection Act in 2012 (“PDPA”). The PDPA subjects all Singapore organizations as “data organizations” to various data protection obligations regarding the collection, processing and use of personal data. Data intermediaries however only have to observed a qualified set of data protection obligations. ""Data intermediaries” are defined in the PDPA as “an organisation which processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but does not include an employee of that other organization.” An organization that qualifies as a “data intermediary” only has to observe limited obligations regarding use of reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data from unauthorized access and similar risks (PDPA section 24) and the obligation to cease to retain personal data when it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which the personal data was collected is no longer being served or when its retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes (PDPA section 25). No other data protection obligations are imposed on “data intermediaries”. For instance, if an individual directs his inquiry to a “data intermediary”, under the PDPA, the “data intermediary” has no obligation to respond to the individual’s request, for instance, to be notified of purpose of the data collection, use or disclosure (PDPA section 20), to be provided with information about the ways in which his personal data has been or may have been used or disclosed and access to his personal data (PDPA section 21) and to correct an error or omission in his personal data (PDPA section 22) as these obligations are only to be observed by the “data organisation”.]
 
Electronic Transactions Act, Parliamentary Legislation, Chapter 88, Revised Edition 2011, Dec 31, 2011 (originally Jul 10, 1998) (An Act to provide for the security and use of electronic transactions, to implement the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 23rd November 2005)
 
[Section 26 in Part IV of the Electronic Transactions Act, which was modeled after Art 1 s 5 of the German Federal Law to Regulate Conditions for Information and Communication Services 1997, provides that a “network service provider” shall not be subject to any civil or criminal liability in respect of “third-party material” in the form of electronic records to which it “merely” “provides access."" This exemption of liability is extended to cover liabilities in respect of data protection obligations with respect to third party material under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012. However this exemption does not extend to cover any obligations founded on contract, under a licensing or regulatory regime, laws or court orders to remove, block or deny access to material and copyright infringement. Of the key terms in this provision, only the terms ”third-party” (a person over whom the provider has no effective control) and “provides access” (the provision of the necessary technical means by which third-party material may be accessed and includes the automatic and temporary storage of the third-party material for the purpose of providing access) have been defined. Presumably, the term “network service provider” is to be given an expansive interpretation. To date, there have been no decided cases on this provision (previously section 10 of the Electronic Transactions Act 1998, Revised Edition 1998). But the breadth of this exemption is limited by the term “merely."" As the Explanatory Statement to the 2010 Bill explains, “The protection under the clause will not apply if the provider does something more than merely providing access to the third-party material.” So the exemption from liability will apply to Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”), hosting and cloud storage providers who provide access and storage services. But the broad exemption will not extend beyond that. Thus network service providers that aggregate or process their users’ personal information, or process the personal information of other service providers would not be regarded as “merely providing access” and would have to observe their data processing obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.]
 

Copyright Act, Parliamentary Legislation, Chapter 63, Revised Edition 2006, January 31, 2006 (originally Apr. 19, 1987) (An Act relating to copyright and matters related thereto)
 
[In 1999, Singapore made its first amendments to the Copyright Act to introduce various safe harbor defenses for Internet intermediaries as network service providers. Arising from its obligations under the U.S. Singapore Free Trade Agreement,  Singapore further revised in 2004 the safe harbor defenses in the Copyright Act for network service providers.
 
(1) Section 193A of the Copyright Act states that the safe harbor defenses are to apply to “network service providers”, which includes ISPs as intermediaries providing services and connections for data transmission or routing, as well as intermediaries who provide or operate facilities for online services or network access. It would seem that “network service providers” are broadly defined so that most Internet intermediaries would qualify for the safe harbor defenses. In the Singapore High Court decision in RecordTV Pte Ltd v. MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd, [2009] SGHC 287 (Sing. H.C.) (“RecordTV”), the Singapore High Court chose to interpret section 193A to apply only to “bona fide” network service providers.  The court did not explain what it meant by a “bona fide” network service provider, only that as RecordTV made copies of the rightholders’ programming, it was not considered one that is bona fide.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal, which reversed the High Court for holding RecordTV liable, did not discuss this judicial gloss placed on the safe harbor defense. 
 
(2) The four safe harbor defenses mirror the same defenses in the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Section 193B, modeled after 17 U.S.C. § 512(a), indemnifies an ISP (as a subclass of a “network service provider”) from monetary relief for any copyright infringement that occurs by reason of the transmission, routing, provision of connections or transient storage by the ISP of an electronic copy of the material. To qualify for this defense, the transmission must be initiated by a person (other than the ISP), the transmission must be carried out without any selection of the material, the ISP must not select the recipients of the material except by way of an automatic response, and the ISP must not make any substantive modifications to the material during its transmission. In RecordTV, the Internet intermediary sought to bring itself under this safe harbor defense. This was rightly rejected by the court, because the operations of RecordTV could hardly be characterized as an “automatic technical process” of an ISP, although it would have been easier for the court to dismiss this defense simply on the grounds that RecordTV is not an ISP.
 
(3) Section 193C of the Singapore Copyright Act, modeled after 17 U.S.C. § 512(b), indemnifies a network service provider for making, through an automatic process, a cached copy of a work on its network from the originating network, in response to a user’s action, in order to facilitate efficient access to the material by its users. The conditions are that the network service provider will not make any substantive modifications to the content of the cached copy, and if it is furnished with a take-down notice, it is to expeditiously take reasonable steps to remove or disable access to the cached copy of the work on its network.  In addition, it has to satisfy other conditions that the Minister may prescribe, including conditions relating to access to the copy, the refreshing, reloading or updating of the cached copy and non-interference with any technology used by the originating network to obtain information about usage of the material. 
 
(4) Section 193D of the Singapore Copyright Act, modeled after 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) and (d), indemnify a network service provider for providing hosting and referral services from monetary relief for any copyright infringement arising from its activities. To qualify for protection, a network service provider providing hosting services that involve storing an electronic copy of the infringing material on its work must not receive any direct financial benefit from the infringement, and has to designate a representative to receive the prescribed take-down notices.  Likewise, a network service provider providing referral or linking services must not receive any direct financial benefit from the infringement, and has to designate a representative to receive the prescribed take-down notices.  The hosting or referring network service provider will lose the indemnity if upon acquiring actual knowledge of such facts or circumstances “which would lead inevitably to the conclusion” of infringement, or is furnished with a prescribed take-down notice, it does not expeditiously take reasonable steps to remove or disable access to the infringing material.  
 
(5) Notwithstanding the safe harbor conditions which a network service provider has to observe to qualify for indemnity, section 193A of the Copyright Act states that a network service provider is not obliged to monitor its service or affirmatively seeking facts to indicate infringing activity, or to gain access to, remove or disable access to any infringing material.  However, to qualify for the safe harbors, a network service provider has to adopt and reasonably implement a policy for termination of repeat offenders, and must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures for identification or protection of copyrighted material.]


BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

 

Bill, Apr 7, 2014, Proposed Amendments to Revise the Copyright Act to empower the courts to make site blocking orders
 
[The Singapore Ministry of Law is proposing legislative amendments to allow right holders to apply directly to the courts for injunctions against Internet Service Providers to prevent users from accessing the so-called “pirate sites” without having to first establish ISPs’ liability for copyright infringement. The so-called “pirated sites”, known in the proposal as “egregious online locations”, are to be assessed by the courts based on certain non-exhaustive factors, including (1) whether the online location’s primary purpose is to commit or facilitate copyright infringement, (2) whether it makes available or contains directories, indexes or categories of the “means to commit copyright infringement”, (3) whether the owner of the location “demonstrates a disregard for copyright”, (4) whether the location has been disabled by court orders from other countries on grounds of copyright infringement, (5) whether the location contains guides or instructions on circumventing measures to disable access to the location, and (6) the number of visitors to the online location. It is proposed that the injunction be permanent, although site owners, ISPs or right holders can apply to the courts to overturn the injunction. It is also proposed that applicants to an existing injunction can more easily apply for another injunction or vary the original injunction in relation to the location that has assumed a different IP address or URL.]

DECISIONS

 

Superior Courts


Court of Appeal, Civil Action, RecordTV Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd, [2011] 1 SLR 830; [2010] SGCA 43, December 1, 2010
 
[(1) The appellant/plaintiff, RecordTV, was the provider of a remote-store digital video recorder service, known as iDVR or Internet digital video recorder, which allowed its registered users to request the recording of the respondents/defendants' free-to-air broadcasts in Singapore, based on the scheduling information of the respondents' programming which the appellant has provided. The respondents' broadcasts were received by the appellant's roof-mounted antenna and routed to the appellant's recording computers. If a registered user requested a recording, the appellant's control software would instruct the system to record the said program. Once a recording was made and stored on the appellant's premises' computers, it was made available for viewing to the user who requested the recording on their computers or their TVs. At the end of 15 days after the date of recording, the recordings were deleted.
 
(2) In relation to its recording system, the appellant's system underwent three configuration changes. In phase 1, the system eliminated the duplication of copies and made only 1 recording despite multiple registered users' requests for the same program to be recorded. In phase 2, the system would make multiple copies of recordings based on multiple user requests for the same programming, but would switch to a single copy being made if system resources were insufficient. In phase 3, the system was reconfigured so that individual copies of the same programming were made for each requesting registered user. The changes were ostensibly made in response to the judgment of the 2nd Circuit in the Cartoon Network LP v CSC Holdings (the Cablevision case). (For purposes of these proceedings, only the appellant's system in relation to phase 1 and phase 2 were in issue.)
 
(3) The respondents' objected, contending that the use of iDVR infringed its copyright in its MediaCorp programming (broadcasts and films). When the defendant commenced groundless threats of infringement proceedings, the plaintiffs in turn counterclaimed for copyright infringement and sought injunctive relief.
 
(4) The High Court allowed the respondents' claim against the appellant for copyright infringement. The appellant appealed. 
 
(5) The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court. It found that it was the registered users requesting the recording of the shows using the appellant's iDVR service rather than the appellant who copied the respondents' programming. 
 
(6) The court also held that the appellant did not communicate the recorded shows to the public – it was the registered users who requested the recording of a particular show and the registered users who did so did not constitute ""the public"" for purposes of ss 83 and 84 of the Copyright Act.
 
(7) The court also held that there is no reason why the aggregate of private and individual communications made to each registered user should transform the nature of such communications into ""public"" communications. Each registered user could only access the particular show he had requested to be recorded, and not the entire library of recorded works made by the appellant. 
 
(8) Finally, the court held that the appellant did not authorize the registered users to do any act comprised in the respondents' copyright in their programming. To determine if there is authorization liability, four authorization liability factors have to be considered and evaluated in their totality in the context of the factual matrix of each case: (a) whether the alleged authorizer had control over the means by which copyright infringement was committed and hence, a power to prevent such infringement, (b) the nature of the relationship (if any) between the alleged authorizer and the actual infringer, (c) whether the alleged authorizer took reasonable steps to prevent or avoid copyright infringement, and (d) whether the alleged authorizer had actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence of copyright infringement or the likelihood of such infringement occurring. On the facts, (a) while the appellant did have the power to prevent potential infringement of the respondents' copyright in its programming by shutting down its iDVR service altogether, it was not necessary to take this drastic step as it had expressly stated in its terms of use that registered users could only use its service to record those shows which they could otherwise legally view and record, (b) while there was a commercial relationship between the appellant and its users, on the evidence, the appellant did not benefit commercially, although the users benefited socially, and there was nothing wrong if the appellant profited from providing its service, (c) the appellant streamed its recorded shows to the users, rather than allowing its users to download them, thereby preventing illegal distribution, and provided in its terms that the recording was only to be used for personal, private and domestic use and only for those shows which a registered user could otherwise legally view and record, meaning that only those registered users in Singapore who held valid TV licenses could use the appellant's iDVR to record the respondents' shows, and not those out of jurisdiction, and (d) given the precautions taken, in absence of express proof of knowledge, it was not right to attribute knowledge of improper usage to the appellant.  For all these reasons, the court held that the appellant was not liable for authorizing the doing of any act comprised in the respondents' copyright in its programming. 
 
(9) The court did not have to deal with the defenses of safe harbor protection and fair use.
 
High Court, Civil Action, Odex Pte. Ltd. v. Pacific Internet Ltd., [2008] SGHC 35, [2008] 3 SLR 18, March 22, 2001
 
[(1) Odex was a private company that provided Japanese anime programs to local television stations for broadcasting. It also distributed authorized copies of these programs to retailers for sale to the public. Odex alleged that with Internet piracy and the ease of obtaining DVD-quality movie files for free via P2P software, its sales of anime video titles had begun to drop significantly and that TV stations also bought fewer anime titles as they were allegedly losing viewership to illegal downloaders. 
 
(2) To address this problem, Odex engaged the services of BayTSP.com Incorporated (BayTSP), an American company, to collect and track instances of unauthorized uploading and downloading of copies of Japanese anime video titles. Through BayTSP, Odex discovered that there had been more than 474,000 unique downloads over an 11-month period, based on searches conducted on only 50 out of more than 400 authorized titles. In these circumstances, Odex applied under Order 24 Rule 6(5) of the Singapore Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) for the pre-action discovery of documents from various local Internet service providers, to identify the illegal downloaders, based on 981 selected IP addresses of Internet users who were recorded as having carried out the highest instances of such uploading and downloading via the BitTorrent protocol. The defendant Pacific Internet, a local Internet service provider, resisted that application. 
 
(3) Odex’s application for a discovery order failed before the District Court, which held that Odex did not have the locus standi to make the application, since it was only a sub-licensee for most of the video titles (whose infringement Odex complained of). For one title for which Odex was held to be the exclusive licensee (“Mobile Suit Gundam Seed”), the District Court was of the view that Odex had to show an extremely song prima facie case of wrongdoing before the order sought would be made in its favour. As Odex had failed to establish such a case, its application was dismissed. 
 
(4) Odex appealed. 
 
(5) The High Court rejected Odex’s argument that it had the requisite locus standi to apply for a discovery order, in reliance on the Practice Direction 4 of 2005 (“Applications for discovery or interrogatories against network service providers in relation to specific intellectual property issues”) and the Singapore Copyright (Network Service Provider) Regulations 2005 (S 220/2005). Odex had argued that both the Practice Direction and the Regulations refer to an application made “on behalf of a copyright owner”, and in doing so, sanctioned its application as a licensee. The court observed that the Practice Direction did not have the force of substantive law, and that Regulation 3(2)(b) did not pertain to discovery applications. The court also noted that the Singapore Copyright Act did not have an equivalent provision to 17 U.S.C. § 512(h)(1), which would enable a copyright owner or “a person authorised to act on the owner’s behalf” to issue a subpoena to a service provider for identifying an alleged infringer. 
 
(6) The court held that an agent of a copyright owner or an exclusive licensee could not apply in the agent’s own name for pre-action discovery in order to identify infringers. While the copyright owners could use the services of an agent to track down infringers, they had to use their own names to commence civil court proceedings, apply for pre-action discovery and take formal action for substantive relief. Even if Odex were not relying on Order 24 Rule 6(1) for a discovery order but on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to issue a Norwich Pharmacal discovery order, it still had no locus standi to invoke the court’s jurisdiction. Nor could Odex merely claim that it would only use the information to initiate criminal proceedings because as a mere agent, it could not claim to be the right party entitled to relief. 
 
(7) The court reversed the District Court on the requirement for an extremely strong prima facie case of wrongdoing, holding that the court below had prescribed too high a standard of proof. Where there was evidence of wrongdoing, the court would consider the strength of the case by the applicant for discovery order as one of the factors to be considered in the totality of the facts before deciding whether to grant the order in the interest of justice.
 
(8) Nonetheless, the court concluded that it was inexpedient to have the copyright owners start the discovery application all over, especially where on the current appeal, there was an application by some copyright owners to be added as plaintiffs. The court allowed these owners to be added as plaintiffs and allowed disclosure of the subscribers’ information to these plaintiffs as copyright owners for their respective video titles.]

LEGISLATION



Standards for Assessment of Internet Enterprises' Protection of Personal Information, March 15, 2014 
 
[These industrial standards define ISPs into three categories: original service/connection provider, information provider and processor, and third party intermediaries who do not link to users' personal information directly. These standards preliminarily put obligations on ISPs when collecting, processing, using, storaging, and transmitting users' personal information such as name, address, date of birth, etc.]
 

Regulation on Protection of the Right to Network Dissemination of Information, State Council Order No. 468, May 18, 2006, amended in accordance with the Decision of the State Council on Amending the Regulation on Protection of the Right to Network Dissemination of Information on January 30, 2013
 
[Clarifying the ""Fair Use"" Exception under the PRC Copyright Law (article 6), standards of network dissemination of information including how to address a potential violation.  Establishing a more stringent standard for continued violators including civil and criminal liabilities for illegal network distributions and cyber equipment associated with such distributions/disseminations.]
 

Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Strengthening the Protection of Online Information, December 28, 2012 [English Version] 
 
[Imposing further regulations on ISPs and business enterprises, and non-profits to handle electronic personal information including: (1) stating explicitly the purpose, means and scope of such personal information collection and usage, (2) publicizing widely relevant policies and obtain consent of such collection, (3) prohibiting disclosure, alteration, selling, or destruction of collected electronic personal information, (4) adopting technical and other necessary measures to ensure the safety of electronic personal information, and must promptly take remedial measures when such information is disclosed, damaged or lost, (5) promptly taking any remedial measures if anything of the above occurs, (6) and requiring ISPs to mandate users to furnish authentic identity information when providing access or information related services to the users.]

 
Judicial Interpretation No. 20 [2012] of the Supreme People's Court on Several Issues concerning the Application of Law in Hearing Civil Dispute Cases Involving Infringement of the Right of Dissemination on Information Networks, December 17, 2012 [English Version]
 
[This Judicial Interpretation provides the detailed rules on deciding Internet intermediary’s liability for copyright infringement.
 
(1) First, whether an Internet intermediary ought to be liable mainly depends whether it is at fault for the copyright infringement in question. In light of Article 8, the fault means Internet intermediaries actually know or should know the copyright infringement concerned.
 
(2) Second, the Judicial Interpretation (Article 8) clarifies that Internet intermediaries have no obligation to actively monitor their services, and if they have already taken reasonable and effective technical measures but still could not know the infringement, they should not be held as being at fault.
 
(3) Third, regarding what constitutes “should know”, the Judicial Interpretation (Article 9, 10 and 12) enumerates several factors for lower courts to comprehensively assess when deciding Internet Intermediaries’ liability.
 
(4) Fourth, with regard to the benefits made by Internet intermediaries, the Judicial Interpretation differentiates between direct benefits and indirect benefits (Article 11). If an Internet intermediary receive direct benefits from infringing materials, it ought to undertake higher level of duty of care to its user’ conducts.
 
(5) Fifth, regarding notice-and-takedown procedure, the Judicial Interpretation lists several factors for lower courts to decide what constitutes “expeditiously remove” (Article 14).
 
(6) Sixth, the Judicial Interpretation brings in inducement infringement. According to Article 7, where an Internet intermediary induces or encourages Internet users to infringe others’ copyright by delivering words, offering technical support, or rewarding credits, it shall be concluded to have committed inducing infringements.]

Beijing Higher People’s Court [北京市高级人民法院], Zhong Qin Wen v. Baidu [中青文v.百度], 2014 Gao Min Zhong Zi No. 2045, [（2014）高民终字第2045号], 2014
[copyright, hosting provider, BaiduWenku, 
 
[(1) In this case, the plaintiff Zhong Qin Wen found some of its copyrighted works made available on the platform BaiduWenku and sued Baidu for copyright infringement. Baidu claimed that BaiduWenku was just a platform for Internet users to upload and share materials, and it had fulfill reasonable duty of care to prevent infringement on its platform, so it should not be held liable.  
 
(2) The Beijing First Intermediate People’s Court held that Baidu was incapable of monitoring all uploads and did not directly benefit from infringement, but should know the infringing uploads in question.  According to the decision, the defendant Baidu kept the viewing and downloading data of each uploaded work. By using current technologies, it was reasonable for Baidu to execute a monitoring mechanism in light of which, once an uploaded work has been viewed or downloaded more than certain times, Baidu needs to inspect the potential copyright status of the work by contacting the uploader, checking whether the work is originally created by the uploader or legally authorized by the copyright owners. In this case, the plaintiff’s works had been viewed by a high volume of users. However, Baidu failed to exercise its duty to examine the legal status of the plaintiff’s works and should have known that the plaintiff’s works were illegally uploaded.  
 
(3) On appeal, Beijing Higher People’s Court upheld the previous decision.  This case sets a duty for Internet hosting providers to protect popular works. Because once a copy of a popular work is uploaded on a platform, it tends to attract many views and downloads. However, both Beijing First Immediate People’s Court and Beijing Higher People’s Court did not set a clear indication on deciding how many times of views or downloads are enough to trigger the examining duty, which puts hosting providers' liability in uncertainty.
 
Beijing High Court, Go East Entertainment Co. Ltd. (H.K.) v. Beijing Alibaba Technology Co., Ltd., (2007) Er Zhong Min Chu Zi No. 02627, December 20, 2007
[copyright, music, domain, defenses, search engine]
 
[Court held that defendant search engine Alibaba is liable for taking down 15 of the 26 allegedly infringing recording in accordance with the take-down notices.  Although Alibaba claims that it removed all 15 links that the Plaintiff sent them in regards to the take-down, the Court held that Alibaba should know that its 26 recordings are infringing Plaintiff’s copyright and thus Alibaba is negligent in discharging its duty to take steps to terminate the links to all 26 recordings.]
 
Beijing District High Court , EMI Group Hong Kong Limited v. Beijing Baidu Network Technology Co. Ltd., (2007) Gao Min Zhong Zi No. 593, November 17, 2006
[Search engine, copyright, streaming, music, domain, defenses]
 
[Court rejected EMI’s claim against the search engine Baidu because EMI’s take-down notice to Baidu did not comply with the requisite formalities, and thus failed to specify the names of the works, their authors and the web addresses whose the infringing works were found. The Court cited Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Cases Involving Copyright Disputes over Computer Network (2004): “Where any copyright owner who, upon finding out the infringing information, warns the Internet service provider about this or requests for the network registration material of the infringer, [but] is unable to produce proofs of his [the copyright owner’s] identification, ownership of the copyright and the circumstance of the infringement, such warning or request shall be deemed not to have been made.”]

[(1) In this case, the BBS operated by the defendant “178.com” had a sub-platform for subscribers to upload ePub-formatted e-books, and a copyrighted book owned by the plaintiff had been uploaded without permission, so the plaintiff sued 178.com for copyright infringement.
 
(2) According to the court investigation, the defendant had a policy of rewarding these subscribers who uploaded content or replied to such content with virtual “silver coins”. Further, the defendant also appointed a moderator to manage the materials uploaded by subscribers. In this case, the infringing materials concerned was highlighted and edited by the moderator, so the moderator appointed by the defendant in fact promoted the transmission of infringing materials concerned. Based on the two reasons above, ChaoYang District Court in Beijing held that the defendant had induced its subscribers to commit infringements.] [See here for inclusion of this case among the 50 typical IP cases in 2013 in China]

[copyright, illegal streaming, linking, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, criminal infringement, third party liability, joint or accessory liability]
 
[Holding that the Defendants, developers, and operators of the P2P website and client software “Kuro” liable under Article 130 of the General Principles of the Civil Law, in contributory infringement for intentionally providing assistance to the website users who shared and infringed the copyright holder’s right in its recordings. The Court placed a heavy emphasis on the right compilation and integration between the P2P client software and the system of selection, classification and categorization of the users’ shared recordings which the defendants operated on their website.]

[copyright, secondary liability, search engine]
 
[Holding that if the right holder did not exhaust her obligations to notify an intermediary providing referring services vis-a vis take-down notices, and that there is no evidence to suggest that the intermediary knows or should know that the material he has linked to is infringing, the rightholder cannot maintain a secondary liability claim against the intermediary.]

[copyright, illegal streaming, linking, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, criminal infringement, third party liability, joint or accessory liability]
 
[Holding that the defendant, who operated the website chinamp3.com, was not liable for disseminating the plaintiff’s sound recordings by merely linking to them, by selecting, organizing and finalizing the various links to infringing third party sources. However, because the Defendant could discriminate between licensed and unlicensed recordings, and that the Defendant ignored his duties and intentional participation in the illegal dissemination of unlicensed recordings, Defendant is jointly liable with the third party websites under Article 130 of the General Principles of the Civil Law.]
 


No. 2 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing Municipality, Music Copyright Society of China v. Netease Com., Inc. & Mobile Communications Corp., (2002) Er Zhong Min Chu No. 3119, September 20, 2002
[conduit or transmission defense, copyright, ringtone, copyright defense]
 
[Holding that because Mobile Communications were merely providing a technical and passive service of network dissemination for receiving ringtones sent by Netease and forwarding them to its subscribers, it was not liable to an infringement. The Court further considered evidence that Mobile Communications was unable to select, examine or selectively delete the contents of the messages. Therefore, Mobile Communications has no duty and not at fault for the occurrence of the infringement when Netease used Mobile Communications’ services to transmit unlicensed (copyrighted) ringtones to its subscribers.]

LEGISLATION

Act of July 18, 2002 on Providing Services by Electronic Means, O.J. 2002 No. 144, item 1204 as amended [English Version]
 
[This Act implemented the EU Electronic Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, introducing intermediary liability for unlawful content. Following the Directive it differentiates between mere conduit, catching and hosting, introducing no obligation to monitor or filter hosted or cached content as well as a basic notice-and-takedown procedure. The Act determines obligations of information service providers (ISPs), rules for insulating them from legal liability as well as rules for the protection of personal data treated by the intermediaries.
 
(1) Definitions. According to the Act, “providing services by electronic” means to render a service by transmitting and collecting data by means of teleinformation systems, at the individual request of a service recipient, without the parties being simultaneously present, while the data are transmitted through public networks. It distinguishes between a “service provider” and a “service recipient” whereby the former is understood as “any natural person, legal person or organizational unit without legal entity, who, while performing, even as side activities, commercial or professional activities provides services by electronic means”. The Act does not differentiate between access, service or content providers.  
 
(2) Media and Publishers Liability. Although the Act on rendering electronic services explicitly does not cover media (Article 3), Poland has been one of the first European states to recognize the editorial liability of information service providers (see case State Prosecutor v. Norbert Z. & Tomasz K below).  
 
(3) Spam. The Act covers also intermediary liability for spam introducing an opt-in model of spam protection. Article 9 requires commercial information to be clearly separated and marked in a manner that no doubt may arise that it is information of a commercial character. Article 10 prohibits sending unsolicited commercial information to a specified recipient - who never expressed any specific consent to receive it -  by electronic communication means.
 
(4) Liability Exemptions. Chapter 3 of the Act is devoted to liability exemptions for ISPs. Article 12 introduces the mere conduit exemption stating that no responsibility for conveyed data shall be borne by the one who, while transmitting data, is not an initiator of the transmission, does not select the recipient of data, nor deletes or modifies the data subject to transmission. The exemption covers also automated and short-term indirect storing of such data, if this activity aims exclusively at proceeding with the transmission, and the data are not stored longer than it is ordinarily necessary for accomplishing the transmission. Similarly an exemption for caching services providers is provided in Article 13, which excludes any responsibility for stored data of entities transmitting data and providing for automated and short-term indirect storing of the data in order to make them quickly accessible on the request of another entity if they do not delete or modify the data, use information techniques recognized and usually applied for such activities and do not interfere with such techniques.
 
(5) Notice and Take Down. The notice and takedown procedure for cached illegal content is provided for in Article 13 par. 2 which exempts from liability for stored data the person, who, “immediately erases the data or makes the access to the stored data impossible as soon as he/she receives the message that the data have been erased from the initial source of transmission or the access to them has been made impossible, or a court or any other competent authority has ordered to erase the data or to make the access to them impossible.” Similar regulations relating to hosting providers can be found in Article 14 which exempts from liability for stored data a person, who, while making the resources of a teleinformation system available for the purpose of the data storage by a service recipient, is not aware of unlawful nature of the data or the activity related to them, and in case of “having been officially informed or having received a credible notice on the unlawful nature of the data or the activity related to them, makes the access to the data immediately impossible”. The terms “official information”, “credible notice” and “immediately” have not been defined in the Act nor in accompanying jurisprudence, resulting in much autonomy for service providers in making their decisions. This autonomy requires ISPs to make autonomous decisions on the credibility of the information received, legality of content and due time for such content to be disabled. There is no detailed notice-and-takedown procedure on formal and procedural conditions of filing a notice and its consequences in place, nor is there coherent self regulation in this area, with individual service providers making their decision individually. This situation causes an undesired chilling effect resulting in intermediary service providers disabling most content reported as potentially illegal in order to avoid any liability.
 
(6) Personal Data Protection. The Act introduces also detailed obligations of intermediary service providers regarding the rules of the Personal Data Protection Related to Providing Services by Electronic Means in Articles 16–24.] 
 
Press Law Act of January 26, 1984, O. J. 1984 No. 5, item 24 as amended 
 
[(1) Definitions. According to Article 7 para 2 pt 2 of the Press Law Act press is defined as “any and all existing and emerging in the course of technological advancement means of mass media, including broadcasting stations and television and radio broadcasting systems installed in facilities that distribute periodically publications via print, image, sound or any other broadcasting means” allowing to qualify all periodical online publications as press, resulting in editorial liability for service providers. The terms “publications” and “periodical” have no legal definitions therefore their  dictionary definitions apply, with “publications” referring to all content enabled publicly and “periodically” designating content updated within certain amounts of time. In the context of Article 7 para 2 pt 1, which explicitly qualifies press as printed publications published within less than one year, it may be argued that online publications updated at least once a year fall within that category. A “press release” is defined in Article 7 as any information, data or image that appears or is designated to appear in the press. 
 
(2) Media and Publishers Liability. Editorial liability is defined in Article 37 of the Press Law Act, which states that the “responsibility for harm caused by rights injured due to the publishing of a press release shall be set according to general rules, unless the Act states differently."" Individual standards for editorial liability are defined in Article 38 of the Press Law Act, which provides for joint and several civil liability for damage caused by publishing a press release of “the author, editor or any other person, who had caused for that press material to be published”, including the publisher. The Press Law Act defines an editor as a journalist who decides or co-decides on the publication of a press release, enabling  for the qualification of content providers but also hosting providers as publishers.
 
(3) Registration. The Press Law Act creates two categories of press: daily newspapers and periodicals, where the former is defined as a general-information periodical in print or sound or sound and vision message published more frequently than once a week, and the latter as a periodical print published at least once a year but not more frequently than once a week, as well as messages broadcast by means of sound or sound and vision and any other means. Publishers who must register their publications or face fines. According to a widely criticized 2007 Supreme Court interpretation of the Press Law Act, concerning the electronic periodical ""szyciepoprzemysku,"" any electronic press avaliable on-line must be registered. (see case State Prosecutor v. Norbert Z. & Tomasz K below).]
BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Draft Ammendment of the Act of July 18, 2002 on Providing Services by Electronic Means, UD70, August 13, 2013
 
[The proposed amendments will introduce a comprehensive notice-and-takedown procedure for service providers. The amendments will include modernization and supplementing the provisions of the Act specifying the conditions to be met by electronic services providers to benefit from the exemption of liability for unlawful content posted by users. Provisions of the Act will supplement the existing notice and takedown procedure.]
DECISIONS


Superior Courts

Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, Dariusz B. v the City of E., IV CSK 665/10, July 8, 2011 (Restricted Access Version Available)
[hosting, anonymous content, open networks] 
 
[Providing open access to the Internet does not result in liability for content uploaded by anonymous users. The case was filed by Darius B. who anonymously posted a letter to the President of E. Among the comments to his text was one which included personal details and defaming statements about the plaintiff. The police identified the IP of the computer used for uploading the content. It was sent from an open network provided by the City of E. available to the employees of the city as well as neighboring households. It was not technically possible to identify the individual who posted the comment. The Supreme Court found that no liability for personal rights infringement rests upon the city which provided access to the open network nor was it under an obligation to provide technical tools for identifying individual users of such network.]
 
Supreme Court, Criminal Chamber, State Prosecutor v. Norbert Z. & Tomasz K. (the szyciepoprzemysku case), IV KK 174/07, July 26, 2007
[press law, editorial liability, registration] 
 
[The Polish Supreme Court found that the ""deliberations that, according to the law, publishing press in electronic form does not require registration are wrong and contrary to entrenched doctrine."" Therefore, “the person distributing without registration in the suitable district court, a journal or a periodical on the Internet, regardless whether such a distribution is accompanied by a transmission in print, next to its electronic form, or whether it exists solely in the electronic form on the Internet, suffices to recognize the crime described in art 45 of Press Law as having been committed.”]
 
Appelate Court, Civil, B.K.v. A.J., I ACa 1273/11, January 19, 2012 (Restricted Access Version Available) 
[liability for online comments, hosting, blogs] 
 
[Cracow Appellate Court, reversing the decision of the County Court of First Instance in Tarnów, found that a blogger is not obliged to monitor comments added by guests to the website he is running. The Court confirmed the lack of liability for hosted content, according to Article 14 of the Act on Providing Services by Electronic Means.]

LEGISLATION


Legislative Decree Stb. 2007, 108, March 8, 2007, Law implementing Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC); Article 26d Dutch Copyright Act
 
[Article 26d of the Dutch Copyright Act contains a rule that allows courts to subject an intermediary to an injunction without the intermediary having to commit a tort. The article reads: “At the request of the author, the court can order intermediaries whose services are used by third-parties to infringe on copyright, to stop providing the services that are used to infringe.” It thus provides a basis for a particular type of injunction that is independent from any liability under tort law. According to the Explanatory Memorandum to this article, courts do have to take into account the degree in which the intermediary is involved in the infringement, and the proportionality between the court order’s aim and the loss or damage that is suffered by the intermediary as a consequence of the court order.  If the copyright-holder can just as well sue the infringer, then the court should reject the request].
 
Legislative Decree Stb. 2004, 210, May 25, 2004, Law implementing E-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC); Article 6:196c Dutch Civil Code [English version]
 
[This law implemented the E-Commerce Directive into Dutch law, including an almost verbatim implementation of the limitations on liability of Articles 12 to 14 of the Directive. It added a new article to the Dutch Civil Code (DCC) in a section that deals with Dutch tort law. Section 6:196c DCC lists the limitations on liability subsections (1) to (4). Section 6:196c(5) indicates that the limitations on liability do not preclude the possibility of injunctions. The instruction to EU Member States that they shall not impose general monitoring obligations (Article 15 of the E-Commerce Directive) did not lead to changes in the DCC].
 
Article 6:162 Dutch Civil Code
 
[Article 6:162 DCC is the general basis for claims for damages that arise from torts. On the basis of 6:162(1) DCC, “a person who commits a tort towards another which can be imputed to him, must repair the damage which the other person suffers as a consequence thereof.” Article 6:162(2) DCC provides three categories of torts that need to be repaired. These types of acts are considered ‘onrechtmatig’ (unlawful). The first category of acts is that of a breach of right. An example of such a right is a property right. The second category is that of acts or omissions that violate a statutory duty. This may be the case when a written rule of unfair competition is violated and a competitor of the tortfeasor suffers damage from this violation. The third category relates to acts or omissions that violate a “rule of unwritten law pertaining to proper social conduct”. This last category enables to import all kinds of duties of care. It is this category of tort that is often used to hold intermediaries liable].
 
Article 3:296 Dutch Civil Code
 
[Under Dutch law, injunctions are based on Article 3:296 DCC, which indicates that if someone is obligated to give, to do, or to refrain from doing something towards another, he is ordered so by court. On the basis of this article, intermediaries that commit a tort can be obligated to do or refrain from doing something].
 

SELF-REGULATION

Notice-and-Take-Down Code of Conduct, October 9, 2008 [English Version]
 
[The Dutch government, businesses and interest groups created a code of conduct on  'notice and takedown.' The code contains a procedure to deal with requests to take down content. Endorsement of the code is voluntary. Internet access provider KPN, the Dutch Hosting Service Provider Association, NLKabel (an association of cable network providers). Service providers that are more involved with the provision of content, such as Google and Marktplaats/eBay endorsed the code. Brein, which represents the entertainment industry, has also endorsed the code of conduct].

Hoge Raad [Dutch Supreme Court], Civil law, Lycos v. Pessers, ECLI:NL:HR:2005:AU4019, 25 November 2005
[hosting provider, defamation, disclosure of personal data, duty of care]
 
[The Dutch Supreme Court confirmed a Court of Appeals decision holding that even when a hosting provider itself does not commit a tort by refusing to delete defamatory information on a website, the hosting provider can still act unlawfully by not providing personal data of the author of that information to the person harmed by the information. Lower courts in later cases have applied this standard to service providers in cases of copyright infringement.]

 
Court of Appeals

Gerechtshof Den Haag [Court of Appeals Den Haag], Civil law, Ziggo and XS4ALL v. BREIN, ECLI:NL:GHDHA:2014:88, January 28, 2014
[blocking order, ISPs, torrent site, unproportionate]
 
[The Court of Appeals stroke through the decision of the District Court of Den Haag, which held that Internet access providers Ziggo and XS4ALL had to block access to the website of The Pirate Bay. The Court of Appeals held that the blockade was not effective and proportionate.]
 
Gerechtshof Amsterdam [Court of Appeals Amsterdam], Civil law, GS Media v. Sanoma, ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2013:4019, November 19, 2013
[linking, copyright law, communication to the public, tort law]
 
[The case is about leaked nude photographs of Dutch television-personality Britt Dekker that had yet to appear in Playboy magazine. An unknown person had stored the photographs online with Filefactory’s hosting service. Dutch entertainment website Geenstijl had posted a link to the file containing the photographs. The Court of Appeals of Amsterdam held that linking to copyright-protected material that is available on the web elsewhere is no different from a footnote referring to earlier published works. In principle, linking to copyright-protected works on the web does not communicate those works to the public and does not constitute a copyright infringement. This may be different if the works were untraceable and inaccessible to the public before the intervention. Although Geenstijl was not held liable for copyright infringement, Geenstijl was held liable under tort law for facilitating access to the leaked photographs.]
 
Gerechtshof Leeuwarden [Court of Appeals Leeuwarden], Civil law, Stokke v. Marktplaats, ECLI:NL:GHLEE:2012:BW6296, May 22, 2012 
[online marketplace, advertisement, copyright infringement, hosting exemption]
[Online marketplace Marktplaats is covered by the hosting safe harbor provision in Article 6:196c(4) of the Dutch Civil Code with regard to copyright infringing advertisements. The Court of Appeals held that a service provider is neutral when it provides its service without prejudice to all its users. The fact that an intermediary acquires knowledge through a notification or through the monitoring of its website for unlawful and unwanted information does not imply that the intermediary loses its neutral position.]
 
Gerechtshof Amsterdam [Court of Appeals Amsterdam], Civil law, Shareconnector v. Brein, ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2010:BL7920, March 16, 2010
[peer-to-peer file sharing, hash codes, copyright law, tort law]
 
[The website operator in question had created a website that listed, verified and categorized hash codes that could be used to download copyright protected works on the e-Donkey peer-to-peer file sharing network. These hash codes identified the content of a digital file and could be used to download files available on the peer-to-peer network through peer-to-peer file sharing software. The Court of Appeals considered that the operator did not have digital files at its disposal, nor did the operator play a role in the transmission of files. The Court held that the operator was not liable for copyright infringement as the operator did not communicate copyright-protected works to the public. However, the operator was held liable under tort law for systematically and structurally facilitating the use and presumed uploading of copyrighted materials.] 
 
Gerechtshof Arnhem [Court of Appeals Arnhem], Civil law, NVM v. Alletekoopstaandehuizen.NL, ECLI:NL:GHARN:2006:AY0089, July 4, 2006
[search engine, deep linking, copyright law, communication to the public]
 
[This case is about the liability of an operator of a search engine that offered information on houses for sale. The search engine provided deep links into the websites of the brokers that houses for sale. The brokers argued that these deep links were communications to the public of their copyright-protected materials. The Court of Appeals rejected the claim for copyright infringement. While the brokers had implemented technical measures to prevent deep links from functioning, deep linking to their materials did not constitute a communication to the public of their works.] 
 
Gerechtshof Amsterdam [Court of Appeals Amsterdam], Civil law, Brein v. Techno Design, ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2006:AX7579, June 15, 2006
[search engine, mp3 files, tort law]
 
[This case deals with the liability of an operator of a search engine for MP3-files stored on other locations on the Internet. The Court of Appeals held the search engine operator liable for systematically and structurally referring to unauthorized communications to the public of copyright protected MP3-files.]
 
Gerechtshof Amsterdam [Court of Appeals Amsterdam], Civil law, KaZaA v. Buma/Stemra, ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2002:AE0805, March 28, 2002
[peer-to-peer file sharing software, copyright law]
 
[KaZaA offered peer-to-peer file sharing software that could be used to share all kinds of computer files, including music files. The KaZaA-network was a decentralized network that made use of so called “supernodes” that mediated communication between KaZaA-users. Collective rights management organization Buma/Stemra had argued that KaZaA’s software was used to infringe on copyrights on musical works. After failed negotiations on a licensing-deal, the District Court had ordered KaZaA to take measures to prevent the sharing of music files through KaZaA’s software. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeals of Amsterdam held that KaZaA was unable to take such measures. In an obiter dictum, the Court of Appeals noted that KaZaA, by offering its software, did not infringe on copyrights. If copyrights were infringed, then it must have been KaZaA’s users who infringed on the exclusive rights regarding the musical works. The Court assumed that KaZaA was not used exclusively to infringe on copyrights. Both KaZaA and an expert pointed at a great number of  materials that were authorized, in the public domain, or of which the use was covered covered by an exception in Dutch copyright law. While Buma/Stemra had argued that the purpose of the software was to allow users to engage in sharing of copyright-protected materials, the Court noted that Buma/Stemra had not presented any evidence of this. In sum, the Court saw no reason to accept Buma/Stemra’s contentions, and argued that KaZaA did not act unlawfully by offering its file sharing software. Buma/Stemra appealed against the decision before the Dutch Supreme Court but failed to state a claim on the basis of which the Supreme Court could annul the Court of Appeal’s decision (see: http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:HR:2003:AN7253). Therefore, the Court of Appeal’s decision still stands.]

 
Lower Courts


Rechtbank Amsterdam [District Court Amsterdam], Civil law, X. v. Facebook, ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2015:3984, June 25, 2015
[disclosure of personal data, revenge porn, hosting provider, facebook, duty of care]
 
[(1) The Amsterdam District Court ruled that Facebook has a duty to identify a person who has uploaded a revenge porn video on its social network. 
 
(2) In this case, the video displays a woman, Chantal, performing oral sex on her now ex-boyfriend. A fake account bearing Chantal’s name was created and used to share the private video with her friends and others. Chantal’s ex-boyfriend, who recorded the video, has always denied uploading the video. Although Facebook removed the video within one hour, the video had already found its way online and is still being shared.
 
(3) Chantal went to court and claimed release of information identifying the person who created the fake account and uploaded the video. The Lower Court of Amsterdam today ruled against Facebook. According to the Court, Facebook acted unlawfully by not releasing the information. A duty to release such information exists if someone can only stop unlawful actions of another through the release of personal data by the provider.
 
(4) Although Facebook argued that it no longer possesses the requested information, the Court has doubts whether that actually is the case. The Court therefore ordered Facebook to release any information relating to the owner of the fake account. In case Facebook is unable to release such information, the company should allow an independent third-party to investigate whether Facebook had or still has the information, and what that information entailed or entails.] [See also Stanford CIS blog post]

 
Rechtbank Amsterdam [District Court Amsterdam], Civil law, Kim Holland Productions v. 123Video, ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2010:BP6880, November 24, 2010
[copyright law, video hosting platform, communication to the public]
 
[This case deals with the liability of the operator of video hosting platform 123video.nl, which stored, converted and categorized videos uploaded by its users. The videos in question were of pornographic nature and were uploaded by users without authorization of the copyright-owner. The District Court of Amsterdam held that the operator communicated the uploaded videos to the public and therefore infringed on Kim Holland Production’s copyrights. The Court came to this conclusion because of the operator’s active, mainly automated, involvement in the uploaded content. The operator, for instance, had created a separate category for ‘xxx’ videos, and moved all videos of pornographic nature to this category. Uploaded videos were converted to Flash-video-format, and displayed within the framework of 123video.nl. Moreover, the intermediary generated income through its video hosting platform. The hosting safe harbor of Article 6:196c(4) Dutch Civil Code did not protect the operator from liability.]
 
Rechtbank Utrecht [District Court Utrecht], Civil law, Brein v. Mininova, ECLI:NL:RBUTR:2009:BJ6008, August 26, 2009
[copyright law, peer-to-peer file sharing, torrents, tort law]
 
[This case dealt with the liability of a website operator that stored and made available torrent-files on his website. The District Court held that the storing of torrent-files is not a communication to the public and thus not a copyright infringement. The operator was held liable under tort law for structurally facilitating copyright infringements of its users. Because the operator of the torrent-website categorized the torrent-files, removed files that violated the website’s rules, gave advice on how to download files and incidentally uploaded files himself, the operator was not shielded from liability on the basis of the hosting safe harbor of Article 6:196c(4) of the Dutch Civil Code.]

LEGISLATION


Electronic Transactions Act, No. 6 of 2011
 
[Part VII (§§50-52) of the Electronic Transactions Act dealt with the issue of ‘Intermediaries and Telecommunications Service Providers’. The statutory provisions generally employ a ‘mere conduit’ approach, and do not require intermediaries to actively monitor electronic records and transmission. When knowledge arises that information in a data message or electronic message may result in liability, intermediaries and telecoms service providers are required to remove the information from their systems, and in the case of criminal liability, notify the appropriate law enforcement authority. The legislation also allows for the government to establish subsidiary regulations for codes of conduct and standards to which intermediaries and telecommunications service providers must comply. However, it is understood that no such regulations have been yet established.]
BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

[There are currently no known new legislative proposals on the issue of intermediary liability. However, it is anticipated that in the near future, the government will seek to establish Regulations pursuant to the parent legislation cited above, which will include provisions on the conduct of intermediaries.]

LEGISLATION



Copyright Modernization Act, SC 2012, c 20.
 
[(1) This is an amending Act to the Copyright Act (see below). Section 31.1 expands the exemption granted by section 2.4(1)(4) of the Copyright Act and is essentially a codification of the holdings from SOCAN v CAIP (see below). Section 31.1(1) states that ISPs, provided that they are content neutral, cannot be held liable by providing any means for Internet access. The fact that “any means” for telecommunication is used instead of “the means” necessary for telecommunication, which appears in section 2.4(1)(b), signifies that this provision is intended to cover a wider range of intermediaries that provide access to third party content such as bloggers, video and social networking websites. Moreover, whereas section 2.4(1)(b) is only applicable in cases where the intermediary is involved in the communication of copyright materials, section 31.1(1) covers both communication and reproduction of those materials. 
 
(2) The protection granted by section 31.1 also applies to hosting and caching activities. By virtue of sections 31.1(2) and 31.1(3), ISPs are protected from copyright infringement as a result of caching or other “incidental” acts that provide more efficient Internet services.  Further, under section 31.1(4), ISPs are immune from copyright liability related to hosting unless they know the content provider has been found by a court to infringe copyright. One exception to section 31.1 exists however; it is not available to intermediaries whose primary function is to enable copyright infringement (see section 27(2.3) below).
 
(3) Another key provision this Act sets out is the “notice and notice” regime. Since 2000, many major ISPs have successfully dealt with copyright infringement claims using the informal notice and notice system put in place by the Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) and the music and cable industry. Therefore, sections 41.25 – 41.27 outlines a system are already familiar to major SPIs (note: sections 41.25 and 41.26 are not yet in force). Under the notice and notice regime, a copyright holder can report an infringement by sending a notice to the SPI. The notice must be in writing and include the claimant’s name and address, the material relating to the alleged infringement, the claimant’s interest in the copyright, the type of infringement as well as the location and time of the alleged infringement. Once the ISP receives the notice, it must promptly forward it to the accused subscriber. ISPs are also required to maintain a record of the user who owns the electronic location at which the alleged copyright infringement occurred. This record must be retained for six months but can be extended to one year if an action is commenced. Where the ISP fails to carry out its obligations, it will be liable for statutory damages ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.  However, an exception has been made for search engines or what the Act refers to as “information location tools”. According to section 41.27, as long as search engines are content neutral and not guilty of enabling infringement (see section 27(2.3) below), remedies against them are limited to injunctions.
 
(4) One area the Act is unclear about is under what circumstance will ISPs be held liable for authorizing copyright infringement. According to the decision in SOCAN v CAIP (see below), an ISP may be liable for authorizing infringement if it has notice of a potential copyright infringement and did not take remedial action. Aside from hosting, where liability seem to follow only if the ISP is aware of a court decision confirming the copyright infringement, it remains to be seen whether forwarding a notice to the content provider will be sufficient to meet the “remedial action” requirement or whether more is needed to avoid liability as an authorizer.
 
(5) The Copyright Modernization Act introduces a new basis for ISP liability. According to section 27(2.3), an SPI can incur secondary liability if its service is primarily intended for enabling copyright infringement. What constitute as “enabling” will be determined in light of numerous factors such as how the service was marketed by the ISP and whether it has other functions aside from enabling acts of copyright infringement. 

 
Copyright Act, RSC 1985, c C-42
 
[(1) The most pertinent parts of this Act for intermediaries are sections 2.4(1)(b), 27 and 29. Section 2.4(1)(b), known as the “Common Carrier Exemption”, states that an intermediary is not liable for copyright infringement by merely providing “the means of telecommunication necessary” for others to communicate digital content. 
 
(2) Section 27 pertains to secondary infringement. Pursuant to section 27(1), the copyright owner holds the exclusive right to authorize any activities that involves his/her work. One issue, therefore, is whether intermediaries may be held liable for authorizing infringing acts carried out by their users. Section 27(2) addresses secondary infringement (e.g., when a person sells, imports or distributes illegal copies of material). 
 
(3) Provisions related to fair dealing are also relevant. As per section 29, an intermediary is exempt from copyright infringement if the work is used for research or private study. After the Copyright Modernization Act came into effect (see below), fair dealing also includes works used for education, parody or satire. Under sections 29.1 and 29.2, there are exceptions to fair dealing with works for the purposes of news reporting, criticism or comment.]


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

Trans Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Rights Chapter [confidential text leaked on August 30, 2013]
 
[Canada is partecipating in the negotiation of this international agreement including a section on Internet service provider liability, with countries lining up either in favour of a general notification obligation or a notice-and-takedown system with the prospect of terminating subscriber Internet access and content blocking. Canada favors the former approach.] [See M. Geist Blog post]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts




 
Supreme Court of Canada, Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) v Bell Canada, 2012 SCC 36, July 12, 2012
[copyright, liability, hosting providers, fair dealing]
 
[Companies who allowed their subscribers to preview musical works via online streaming before making a purchase were found to not have infringed the copyright in those works. The Court held that these previews constitute fair dealing because 1) their purpose constitutes “research” under section 29 of the Copyright Act (e.g., research by consumers) and 2) their use is fair according to the six factors laid out in CCH Canadian v LSUC (see below).]
 

Supreme Court of Canada, Crookes v. Newton, 2011 SCC 47, October 19, 2011
[defamation, article, publication, hyperlink]
 
[This case involved hyperlinks in an online article that directed its readers to defamatory materials. The issue is whether this constituted a publication for the purposes of defamation law. For a defamation case to succeed in Canada, the plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement is “published”. Here, the Court held that, unless the hyperlink itself communicates defamatory meaning in the context, the act of hyperlinking is so passive that it does not amount to publication. (paras 21 & 40). That is, to satisfy the publication element, the plaintiff must prove that the intermediary had “knowing involvement in the publication of the relevant words (para 21).]

 

Supreme Court of Canada, Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) v Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers (CAIP), 2004 SCC 45, June 30, 2004
[copyright, defamation, liability, access provider, ISP, conduit, authorization, defence, jurisdiction]
 
[(1) Also known as the Tariff 22 case, this is the leading decision on ISP liability and copyright infringement. The Court denied the claimants royalties for copyrighted materials that were transferred on the Internet. It interpreted section 2.4(1)(b) of the Copyright Act (the “common carrier exception”) and found that ISPs are not liable as long as they are “conduit” for information (para 32). That is, if an intermediary remains content neutral, they are considered not to have communicated the content at all (para 111). For this reason, intermediaries are also immune from defamation liability (para 89). Whether an intermediary is regarded a conduit for information and thus qualifying for immunity under this section will primarily depend on its function.
 
(2) To successfully use the “innocent disseminator” defence in a defamation action, an intermediary must show that it a) did not know about the publication of the libel; b) did not have any reason to suspect its presence (e.g., by receiving a notice); and c) was not negligent in detecting it.
 
(3) For the purpose of s. 2.4(1)(b), “necessary” means of telecommunication is a means that is “reasonably useful and proper” to achieve the benefits of enhanced economy and efficiency’’ and “of greater or lesser benefit or convenience” (para 91). Previously, the Federal Court of Appeal found that a means is “necessary” only if “communication in that medium of telecommunication would not be practicable or, in all probability, would not have occurred’’ without it (para 113). However, the Supreme Court rejected this high threshold due to the chilling effects it might have on ISPs’ efforts to expand their operations and develop more efficient means of telecommunication.
 
(4) The “means” of telecommunication was held not to be limited to routers and hardware. Rather, it includes all “software connection equipment, connectivity services, hosting and other facilities and services without which such communications would not occur” (para 92). Therefore, this section protects the providers of these means of telecommunication as well.
 
(5) The protection offered by section 2.4(1)(b) also extends to caching and hosting activities. Caching technology was found to be content neutral. Applying the new threshold, caches were found to be a necessary means of telecommunication since they were developed for the very purpose of enabling a more economical way of transmitting large files.  With regards to hosting, ISPs are generally not liable for copyright infringement by contents stored on their servers because the user, and not the intermediary, is deemed to be the content provider. Given the large amount of data being transmitted through the Internet, the Supreme Court noted that it would not be feasible for intermediaries to detect all the material that infringes copyright. However, where an ISP has knowledge of copyrighted content but fails to take remedial steps (para 124), liability may ensue since a failure to respond may constitute authorizing the infringement. 
 
(6) Further, the Court confirmed the findings in CCH Canadian v LSUC (see below) that liability for authorizing copyright infringement will only follow if ISPs “give approval to; sanction, permit; favour, [or] encourage” the infringing conduct (para 127). That is, simply knowing that a neutral technology, such as hosting, might be used to violate copyright laws is not sufficient to support a finding of authorization. 
 
(7) Finally, the case discussed the issue of jurisdiction of the Copyright Act. To determine whether the infringing activity occurred in Canada, the “real and substantial connection” test should be used. Where there is a real and substantial link between the infringing activity and Canada, the Copyright Act will apply. Whether such a connection exists will depend on the specific facts of each case so that the location of the host server will not be determinative. Therefore, an intermediary may not necessarily be liable under the Copyright Act because its host servers are located in Canada. Conversely, an intermediary may not escape liability simply because its host servers are in located abroad.] 
 

Supreme Court of Canada, CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC), 2004 SCC 13, March 4, 2004
[copyright, liability, library, LSUC, fair dealing, authorization]
 
[(1) The LSUC operated a library, and was accused of copyright infringement by providing photocopying services to its patrons. The Supreme Court ruled that the LSUC did not infringe copyright because its dealings with the claimants’ work were for the research purpose of its patrons and was fair. The courts will consider six factor to determine whether a dealing is indeed “fair”: (i) the purpose of the dealing; (ii) the character of the dealing; (iii) the amount of the dealing; (iv) the nature of the work; (v) available alternatives to the dealing and (vi) the effect of the dealing on the work (para 53).
 
(2) Further, the Court held that a finding of authorization of infringement requires proof that the intermediary has done something beyond providing a neutral technology that could be used for copyright infringement. That is, it must be shown that the intermediary acted in a way that gave approval to, sanctioned, permitted; favoured, or encouraged the copyright infringement (para 38). Therefore, the LSUC was not liable for authorizing infringement by virtue of providing photocopiers. The Court further stated that even if an intermediary did authorize the reproduction of copyrighted materials, there is a presumption that it did so in compliance with the law. However, this presumption is rebuttable where there is a relationship between an employer-employee or other similar relationship between the authorizer and the accused or the authorizer has a degree of control over the accused’s actions (Ibid).]
 



Lower Courts


Supreme Court of British Columbia, Equustek Solutions Inc. v. Jack, 2014 BCSC 1063, June 13, 2014
[trade secrets, unfair competition, serch engines, Google, links, de-listing, worldwide]
 
[The Supreme Court of British Columbia issued an order requiring Google to remove websites from its worldwide index.  The dispute involved links to the website of a company that had been found to have stolen trade secrets from a competitor and used unfair competition tactics to lure customers into purchasing the copied products. The court order is unprecedented for Canada as it forces Google to remove links anywhere in the world, rather than only from the search results available through Google.ca.] [See also M. Geist Blog.] [See also Global FoE]
 
Federal Court of Canada, Voltage Pictures v Does, 2014 FC 161, February 20, 2014
[copyright, ISPs, privacy]
 
[(1) This case is an application of the principles laid out in BMG Canada v John Doe (see below) with respect to disclosure orders. Here, the claimant sought the identities of 2,000 users from TekSavvy, an independent ISP. Voltage argued that by downloading movies produced by their company via P2P file-sharing networks, these users infringed copyright in those works and their identities were needed to start legal proceedings. 
 
(2) Although the Court expressed concerns about “copyright trolls”, the disclosure order was ultimately granted because the claimant showed that it had a bona fides claim and privacy rights of the users did not outweigh the interests of the copyright holders. However, numerous safeguards against possible invasions of privacy were attached. For example, users’ information could not be released to the public or be used for any other purposes and Voltage was required to pay TechSavvy the legal costs it incurred in complying with the order. Further, court is required to review any demand letter sent by Voltage to subscribers.]

 
Ontario Superior Court, Morris v Johnson, 2011 ONSC 3996, July 20, 2011
[disclosure, pre-action discovery, website, defamation]
 
[This is another instance where the court applied the Warman factors (see above) to a case concerning online defamation. Here, the plaintiff brought an action against the host of a political blog and its moderators for defamatory comments posted by anonymous commenters. However, the application failed because the plaintiff could not demonstrate that the comments were defamatory and thus, could not establish a prima facie case. Therefore, interests in protecting the freedom of expression and users’ privacy rights outweighed the public benefits that may flow from granting the order.]
 

Ontario Superior Court, Warman v Fournier et al, 2010 ONSC 2126 (Div Ct)
[disclosure, pre-action discovery, defamation, web operator, message board, privacy, freedom of expression].
 
[(1) The plaintiff sued the operator of a message board and eight anonymous participants who allegedly posted defamatory statements. In accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure (76.03), the plaintiff sought an order requiring the intermediary to reveal the identities of those participants. 
 
(2) The court ruled that disclosure of users’ identities should not be automatic. Rather, the unknown user’s expectation of privacy and the freedom of expression must also be weighed. Four factors that should guide the court are: 1) whether the unknown users could have a reasonable expectation of anonymity given the context; 2) whether the complaint has established a prima facie case against the unknown wrongdoers and is acting in good faith; 3) whether the complaint has taken reasonable steps to identify the unknown party; and 4) whether the public interests favouring disclosure outweigh the legitimate interest of freedom of expression and right to privacy (para 34). 
 
(3) The prima facie standard under Rule 76.03 is thus lower than the bona fide standard required for a Norwich order (see York University v Bell Canada below). Given that a defamed plaintiff may compel an intermediary to disclose subscriber information either by going through a pre-action discovery process or by applying for a Norwich order, it has yet to be seen whether the court will reconcile these two standards in the future.]
 
Ontario Superior Court, York University v Bell Canada Enterprises, 2009 99 OR (3d) 695 (ONSC)
[disclosure, Norwich order, defamation, ISPs]
 
[This case involves a defamatory email and web posting written by a faculty group at York University. The plaintiff was granted a Norwich order compelling two ISPs, Bell Canada Enterprises and Rogers Communications, to disclose information about the owner of a specific IP address so that a libel action could be served. To determine whether a Norwich order should be granted in an online defamation case, the court will consider 1) whether the applicant has provided evidence sufficient to raise a valid, bona fide or reasonable claim; 2) whether the applicant has establish a relationship with the third-party from whom the information is sought, such that it establishes that the third party is somehow involved in the acts complained of; 3) whether the third party is the only practicable source of the information available; 4) whether the third party can be indemnified for costs to which the third party may be exposed because of the disclosure and 5) whether the interest of justice favour obtaining the disclosure (para 13).]
 
Court of Appeal for British Clolumbia, Carter v. B.C. Federation of Foster Parent Assn., 2005 BCCA 398, August 3, 2005
[defamation, defence, web operator]
 
[The court held an operator of a discussion forum liable for the defamatory remarks posted by its participants because he did not contact his ISP and remove them within a reasonable time after being notified by the complainant. The court further confirmed that the defence of innocent disseminator (see SOCAN v CAIP above), is not available to a website operator once he has received a notice about the offending content. This case suggest that there is effectively a “notice and take down” regime that intermediaries must follow in order to avoid liability in a cyber-libel action.]
 
Federal Court of Canada, BMG Canada Inc v John Doe, 2004 FC 488, March 31, 2004
[copyright, ISPs, privacy, P2P file-sharing, authorization]
 
[Representatives from the recording industry sought an order to compel various ISPs to disclose the identity of those who used P2P file-sharing networks (KaZaA and iMesh) to share and download over 1000 music files that were protected by copyright. The court held that an order for the release of subscriber information may be granted if the copyright holder can show a bona fide claim and different interests including the subscribers’ privacy rights must be be balanced. Here, the order was denied because privacy concerns outweighed the benefits of disclosure. It was also noted that even if a disclosure is granted, the court could place certain restrictions on the order to protect the privacy interests of the accused.] 
 
Ontario Superior Court, Irwin Toy v Doe, 2000 OJ No 3318, September 8, 2000
[defamation, disclosure, ISP]
 
[This case demonstrates a successful application for a disclosure order under the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure (30.10 and 31.10). Defamatory emails were sent to 75 employees working at the plaintiff’s company. The plaintiff was able to trace those emails to particular IP addresses belonging to the ISP company iPrimus. Given that the plaintiff established a prima facie case, the ISP was required to reveal the owners of the IP addresses in question. The court also noted that ISPs does not have an obligation to disclose user information without a court order.]

LEGISLATION


Guidelines No. 29474/2006, December 14, 2006, Guidelines for the Recognition of Industry Representative Bodies of Information System Service Providers
 
[Setting forth some general principles (section 2), minimum requirements (section 5) and some preferred requirements (section 6) for the codes of conducts to be adopted by industry representative bodies].
 
Act N. 25/2002, July 31, 2002, Electronic Communications and Transactions Act
 
[(1) Introducing liability limitations for mere conduit (section 73), caching (section 74), hosting (section 75) and information location tools (section 76).
 
(2) The conditions to fall under these categories differ from the corresponding provisions in Europe since they require complainants to use a specific procedure of notice and takedown (described in section 77), but at the same time differ from the provisions in the United States as they require such specific procedure to be followed only in case of hosting and caching, and not for information location tools.
 
(3) Furthermore, the limitations are partial as they do not extend to injunctions - and in the case of hosts and information location providers to criminal liability as well - and do not affect obligations of service providers founded on an agreement, a licensing or regulatory scheme or any other obligation imposed to remove, block or deny access to any data message (section 79).
 
(4) But the most distinctive feature of this regime is the conditioning of any liability limitation to the membership of an industry representative body recognized by the Minister of Communications (section 72), provided that membership is subject to adequate criteria, that its members are subject to a code of conduct, that such code requires continued adherence to adequate standards of conduct and that the representative body is capable of monitoring and enforcing compliance adequately (section 71)].

 
Act No. 4 /2000, February 9, 2000, Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair & Discrimination Act
 
[Establishing civil liability for any person found to disseminate, broadcast, publish or display any content that could reasonably be construed or reasonably be understood to demonstrate a clear intention to unfairly discriminate against any person (section 12); and civil as well as potentially criminal liability (upon discretion of the Director of Public Prosecution) for any person who is found to “publish, propagate, advocate or communicate words based on one or more of the prohibited grounds (i.e., race, gender, disability), against any person, that could reasonably be construed to demonstrate a clear intention to (a) be hurtful; (b) be harmful or to incite harm; or (c) promote or propagate hatred (section 10)].
 

Act No. 65/1996, November 8, 1996, Film and Publications Act
 
[Establishing the obligation of IAPs, subject to criminal sanctions (section 27 (A) (4)), to: (a) register with the Board in the manner prescribed by regulations made under this Act; (b) take all reasonable steps to prevent the use of their services for the hosting or distribution of child pornography (section 27 (A) (1)); (c) upon discovery of the use of their services to host or distribute child pornographic material, report to the police the presence thereof, as well as the particulars of the person maintaining or hosting or distributing or in any manner contributing to such Internet address; and (c1) take all reasonable steps to preserve such evidence for purposes of investigation and prosecution by the relevant authorities (section 27 (A) (2)].
 
Act No. 98/1978, June 20, 1978, Copyright Act 
 
[Subjecting to liability for damages, interdict, delivery of infringing copies (section 24)… “any person who…does or causes any other person to do … any act which the owner has the exclusive rights to do or to authorize” (section 23) to criminal liability “any person who … without the authority of the owner of the copyright: … distributes … to such an extent that the owner of the copyright is prejudicially affected, articles which he knows to be infringing copies of the work (section 27)].
 

SELF-REGULATION


Internet Service Provider Association (ISPA) Code of Conduct
 
[Establishing wide-ranging obligations in terms of freedom of expression (section A), privacy and confidentiality (section B), consumer protection (section C), standard terms and conditions (section D), spam (section E), cybercrime (section F), protection of minors (section G) and removal of content (section I) In addition, the Code provides that members must “conduct themselves lawfully at all times and …co-operate with law enforcement authorities where there is a legal obligation to do so”, …”respect intellectual property rights and not willingly infringe such rights”…as well as “uphold and abide by this Code of Conduct and adhere to the associated complaints and disciplinary procedures”(section H). In this respect, the Code proscribes that ISPA members must receive and investigate complaints (provided that they are not frivolous, unreasonable, vexatious or in bad faith) and make all reasonable efforts to resolve them in accordance with the complaints procedure, and empowers ISPA to initiate investigations and institute disciplinary proceedings on its own initiative (section K)]. 
 
ISPA Takedown procedure
 
[Detailing a specific timeline and procedure for members to respond to notices submitted in accordance with section 77 of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act]. 
BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS


Draft bill [not yet introduced into Parliament], August 26, 2013, Draft Policy Framework on Combating Hate Crimes, Hate Speech and Unfair Discrimination
 
[(1) establishing the concept of hate crime in South African criminal law; (2) making other forms of unfair discrimination a crime; and (3) developing measures to combat hate crime, hate speech and unfair discrimination].
 


Bill No. 35821/2012, October 26, 2012, amending the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act
 
[(1) introducing into the notice and takedown procedure identified in section 77 the opportunity for the ISP (and not the alleged infringer) to respond in writing to a first take-down notice within 10 business days (but the period may be reduced in cases of urgency), and the obligation for the complainant to give due consideration to such response; 
 
(2) empowering the complainant to issue a so called “final takedown notice”, if the complaint has not been resolved to his satisfaction or if no response is received in the above mentioned time period; 
 
(3) establishing  potential liability “for a related offence” (sic!) when a service provider does not comply with a final takedown notice within 10 business days].

Supreme Court, Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele v Mail & Guardian Limited, 2004 (6). SA 329 (SCA), August 2, 2004
[defamation; liability; defense, reasonableness]
 
[Clarifying that whether the publication of a potentially defamatory comment is “fair” or “reasonable” depends on the relevant circumstances, such as the interest of the public in being informed; the manner of publication; the tone of the material published; the extent of public concern in the information; the reliability of the source; the steps taken to verify the truth of the information; and whether the person defamed has been given the opportunity to comment on the statement before publication].
 
Constitutional Court, Khumalo and Others v Holomisa , [2002] ZACC 12; 2002 (5) SA 401; 2002 (8) BCLR 771, June 14, 2002
[defamation; liability; media; negligence-based]
 
[Recognizing that the mass media have a particular role in the protection of freedom of expression — to ensure that individual citizens are able to receive and impart information and ideas — and are thus bearers of both constitutional rights and obligations. Differentiating for this reason media defendant from ordinary members of the public, which can rely on the absence of animus injuriandi as a defense, and concluding that liability of media for defamation should not be limited to proven falsehood, but should rather be based on negligence]. 
 
Supreme Court, National Media Ltd v Bogoshi 1998 (4) SA 1196 (SCA), September 29, 1998
[defamation; liability; excusable error; negligence] 
 
[Identifying two defences from liability for defamation: (1) that defamatory comments were true and of public interest contents of a defamatory statement were true and their publication to the benefit of the public; and (2) where it can be proved that, although the statement was not true, publication was nevertheless reasonable].
 

High Courts


South Gauteng High Court, Ketler Investments CC t/a Ketler Presentations v Internet Service Providers Association, (2012/1249) [2013] ZAGPJHC 232 , September 19, 2013
[defamation, liability, spam, code of conduct, truth defense] 
 
[Finding that publication of the name of the applicant in the “Hall of Shame” list of spammers by the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) was justified by its true character and by the public interest served by the publication. This decision by ISPA was based on the definition of spam contained in its code of conduct, which supplements the generic notion of spam identified by section 45 of the Electronic Communication and Transactions Act and does not afford non-members an opportunity to be heard before being included in such list].
 
South Gauteng High Court, H v W, (12/10142) [2013 ZAGP JHC 1; 2013 (2) SA 530 (GSJ) 2013 (5) BCLR 554 (GSJ); [2013] 2 All SA 218 (GSJ), January 30, 2013
[defamation; injunctive relief; no injunction against ISP]
 
[Ordering a user to remove defamatory content, but declining to enjoin the respondent from posting any information pertaining to the applicant on Facebook or any other social media, and declining to order Facebook to remove specific material from a user’s webpage (but raising the question of whether the police would have the competence to do so upon failure to act by the user)].
 

South Gauteng High Court, Tschilas and Another v Touch Line media (Pty) LTD,  2004 (2) SA 112 (W), June 26, 2003 
[defamation; safe harbor; information service provider]

62,Slovakia,"Legislation | Decisions | Other Resources | Contributors | Feedback | Return to WILMAP Home Page
SUMMARY (provided by Martin Husovec): (1) Slovak law has a very small experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries. Most of the decided or pending cases concern instances of online defamation. There is no special liability basis for intermediaries. Safe harbors of e-Commerce directive can especially bar application of the general tort law in cases where wrongful omission could have been established. 

 
(2) General tort law establishes direct liability of an intermediary when he himself or with his co-tortfeasors fulfills all the elements of a tort by infringing the right of others. This qualification depends on the right that is being infringed, and can be different for different fields of law, e.g. personality rights infringement and copyright infringement can treat an intermediary differently. Own content of an intermediary would usually lead to a direct liability. 
 
(3) If the intermediary did not act as a direct infringer, he can be liable under one of the following legal institutions: (i) accessory liability (liability as a participant), (ii) vicarious liability (§ 420(2) Civil Code), (iii) wrongful omission (§§ 415, 420 Civil Code + absolute right at stake). 
 
(4) Unlike in criminal law, accessory liability is not well-developed in Slovak civil law. The courts seldom distinguish it from other basis of liability. The inspiration of the principles upon which it is based hence comes mainly from criminal law. This requires intentional assistance of third parties in wrongful acts of others. Nevertheless, it is possible that accessory liability under civil law could develop into a more broad concept, where also negligence would suffice. At this point, however, there are no signs of such a move in case law. 
 
(5) Vicarious liability under § 420(2) of the Civil Code can apply only to a small number of cases. Under this provision the damage shall be considered caused by a legal entity or also by an individual if they were caused in the course of their activity by those who were used in such activity. These persons themselves shall not be liable for the damage caused in this way. Slovak courts so far did not apply the provision to any intermediary scenario. 
 
(6) Wrongful omission is probably the most important basis of civil liability in the context of intermediaries. Despite virtually no case law, the law enables to hold negligent omission of intermediaries wrongful and attach a liability to such inactivity provided that certain standard of duty of care is breached. 
 
(7) It is worth mentioning that the Slovak safe harboring system is of very inferior quality. The law implementing the e-Commerce directive was adopted in the period of entry of Slovak to European Union, when thousands of acts were very quickly passed to satisfy the Union law. The main problems are extension of actual knowledge requirement also to mere conduits and caching providers, wording of prohibition of the general monitoring obligation that borders with nonsense and narrow definition of the hosting activities. Slovak implementation also drops constructive knowledge standards. Most of the issues are possible to overcome with interpretation in accordance with the Union law. Contrary to what was reported in the EU study, Slovak law has no special rules on notice and takedown procedures. 
 
(8) Injunctions can be issued against intermediaries even if they are not infringing on the rights of others. In the field of intellectual property law, the implementation of Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive and Art. 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive enables this. The relevant provisions are incorporated in the individual intellectual property rights laws (e.g. Copyright Act, Design Law Act, etc.). It is not yet clarified if the same is possible in the field of personality rights and unfair competition law.]

LEGISLATION


Law No. 22/2004, December 3, 2003, on Electronic Commerce
 
[The Act implements e-Commerce Directive into Slovak law incorporating mere conduit, caching and hosting safe harbors, and prohibition of general monitoring obligation (§ 6). The implementation is of very inferior quality and misimplements several mechanisms that are most of the time possible to correct by the interpretation.]
 
Law No. 40/1964, February 26, 1964, Civil Code
 
[The Civil Code provides for all general tort law basis for liability including vicarious liability, wrongful omission, liability as a participant, etc.  It regulates substantial part of the private law. Intellectual property rights are regulated by special acts.]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts


Supreme Court [Najvyšší súd SR], Civil, BMW v. SK-NIC, 3 Obo 197/06, May 12, 2007
[domain name authority, trade mark infringement, liability]
 
[The Court rejected a delictual cease and desist claim against the domain authority arguing that it is not liable for registrations carried out by the third parties. The court does not provide extensive explanation for this and neither does it discuss an alternative basis of secondary liability. It can be also argued that this decision is not a good example because the claim that was rejected, although having basis in the delict law, was formulated more as a concrete contractual act that the domain name authority should carry out (withdrawal). Hence the consequences of the decision remain mostly open.] [see also Huťko´s Technology Law blog post]

 
Lower Courts


Court of Appeals [Krajský súd Trenčín], Civil, Stacho v. Klub Strážov, 19Co/35/2012, April 26, 2012
[discussion forum provider, defamation, third party comments, hosting safe harbor]
 
[The Court denied liability of the discussion forum provider for libelous comments of unknown users. The provider was sued without previous notice and takedown request. Although the first instance Court held the provider liable for users comments, without explaining the basis of such liability, the Court of Appeals rejected this because the provider did not act against the right of the plaintiff himself. The Court did not discuss liability for wrongful omission or liability to serve injunctions as a non-infringer. The case was appealed further to the Supreme Court, where it is currently pending.]

63,Czech Republic,"
Legislation | Decisions | Other Resources | Contributors | Feedback | Return to WILMAP Home Page
SUMMARY (provided by Martin Husovec): (1) Czech law has a only a little experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries. There is no special liability basis for intermediaries. Recently passed new civil law makes no changes in this respect. Safe harbors of e-Commerce directive can especially bar application of the general tort law in cases where wrongful omission could have been established. 

 
(2) General tort law establishes direct liability of an intermediary when he himself or with his co-tortfeasors full-fills all the elements of a tort by infringing the right of others. This qualification depends on the right that is being infringed, and can be different for different fields of law, e.g. personality rights infringement and copyright infringement can treat an intermediary differently. Own content of an intermediary would usually lead to a direct liability. 
 
(3) If the intermediary did not act as a direct infringer, he can be liable under one of the following legal institutions: (i) accessory liability (liability as a participant), (ii) vicarious liability (§ 2914 Civil Code), (iii) wrongful omission (§§ 2900, 2901, 2910 Civil Code + absolute right at stake). 
 
(4) Unlike in the criminal law, accessory liability is not well-developed in the Czech civil law. Even though new Czech Civil Code mentions this type of liability in § 2915, it does not define its preconditions. The Czech courts also seldom distinguish it from other basis of liability. The inspiration of the principles upon which it is based hence comes mainly from the criminal law (similarly as in Slovakia). This requires intentional assistance of third parties in wrongful acts of others. Nevertheless, it is possible that accessory liability under civil law could develop into a more broad concept, where also negligence would suffice. At this point, however, there are no signs of such a move in the case-law. 
 
(5) Vicarious liability under § 2914 of the Civil Code can apply only to small number of cases. Under this provision the damage shall be considered caused by a legal entity or by an individual also if they were caused by auxiliaries in the course of their activity for the principal. Czech courts so far did not apply the provision to any intermediary scenario. 
 
(6) Wrongful omission is probably the most important basis of civil liability in the context of intermediaries. As the Civil Code is very new, there is no case-law on this issue in the context of intermediaries, yet. The law, however, enables to hold negligent omission of intermediaries wrongful and attach a liability to such inactivity provided that certain standard of duty of care is breached. Czech law distinguishes cases of negligent wrongful omissions from negligent actions. The former is triggered only in exceptional situations outlined by the law (dangerous activity, close relationship, etc.). 
 
(7) It is worth mentioning that Czech safe harboring system unfortunately instead of the negative language of the Directive (“is not liable if ..”), uses a positive one (“is liable if ..”), which gives an impression that losing of safe harbors leads to establishment of the liability. First Czech decisions interpreting this provision (Prolux and share-rapid.cz) seems to be embracing this reading. Contrary to what was reported in the EU study, Czech law has no special rules on notice and take down procedure. Injunctions can be issued against intermediaries even if they are not infringing rights of others. In the field of intellectual property law, the implementation of Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive and Art. 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive enables this. The relevant provisions are incorporated in Act on Enforcement of Industrial Property Rights and the Copyright Act. It is not yet clarified if the same is possible in the field of personality rights and unfair competition law.

Law No. 480/2004, July 29, 2004, on Some Services of the Information Society
 
[The Act implements e-Commerce Directive into Czech law incorporating mere conduit (§ 3), caching (§ 4) and hosting safe harbors (§ 5), and prohibition of general monitoring obligation (§ 6). The implementation unfortunately instead of the negative language of the Directive (“is not liable if ..”), uses a positive one (“is liable if ..”), which gives an impression that losing of safe harbors leads to establishment of the liability.]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts

Supreme Court [Nejvyšší soud ČR], Civil, Liberec Pirate, 8 Tdo 137/2013, February 27, 2013
[domain name authority, trade mark infringement, liability]
 
[The Court upheld the criminal liability of an operator of video indexing site, which included number of copyright infringing embed links. The Court found that the defendant himself put the links on his website and hence directly infringed the copyright by communicating the works to the public.] [see also eisionline blog; Martin Husovec, Czech Supreme Court: Embedding is Communication to the Public, Kluwer Copyright Blog 2012]
 

Lower Courts


City Court in Prague, First instance court, Civil, Share-rapid.cz, 31 C 72/2011-33, December 12, 2011
[cyberlocker, copyright, communication to the public, hosting safe harbor]
 
[The Court hold an operator of a cyberlocker liable for committing a copyright infringement. As the decision came in the form of the default judgment against the operator, the grounds for the decision were not given. The plaintiff, however, claimed direct copyright infringement, arguing that loosing of the hosting safe harbor leads to communication to the public. If the Court accepted this, or some other basis for liability, is not clear. The Court obliged the defendant to pay 536.000 Czech crowns (19.507 EUR) from the title of unjust enrichment by letting the users to download the work almost 14.000 times by its default judgment. The case was appealed, but was rejected on appeal on merely procedural grounds.] [see also eisionline blog; Martin Husovec, Case Note on the share-rapid.cz Case, 8 Revue pro právo a technologie (2013)]

[discussion forum provider, defamation, third party comments, hosting safe harbor, actual knowledge]
 
[The Court accepted the liability of a discussion forum provider for user comments. Unknown users posted several libelous statements on the website. The discussion provider refused to take them down, arguing that it can not establish its illegal nature. The Court hold the provider liable for an injunction to remove some statements that it found libelous (“like swine”), but rejected to grant any non-material satisfaction in money against the provider. The Court did not question the inverted wording of the Czech hosting safe harbor and readily accepted liability after concluding that hosting safe harbor was lost due to the notice from the plaintiff.] [see also Martin Husovec, Brief Commentary on the Prolux Case, 3 Revue pro právo a technologie (2011)]

[The Court in a regular domain name dispute enabled the domain name transfer against the domain name authority as a defendant arguing that the source of such an injunction is a tort law.]

(2) The law introduced a procedure for “perpetual ban” in relation to sites involved in “repeated” IP infringements, with no right of restatement.
 
(3) The law also introduced a comprehensive notice and take down process that a right holder may, but is not required to, follow before commencing court proceedings. Site owner can elect not to remove infringing content, but in this case must notify the right holder and present respective objections.]
 

Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation, July 31,2014 (the regulation for identified access to public WiFi). 
 
[This resolution was adopted pursuant to the anti-terrorism package of bills and (1) establishes that ISPs should identify Internet users, by means of identity documents (such as passport); (2) ISPs should identify terminal equipment by determining the unique hardware identifier of the data network; (3) all legal entities in Russia are required to provide ISPs monthly with the list of the individuals that connected to the Internet using their network.]

 

Federal Law No. 242-FZ, on Amending Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation as to the Clarification of the Processing of Personal Data in Information and Telecommunications Networks, July 21, 2014
 
[(1) The law that came into effect on September 1, 2015. It requires that the processing of personal data of Russian citizens be conducted with the use of servers located in Russia. Operators that process personal data of Russian citizens have to notify Roscomnadzor of the location of their servers where such personal data is stored.

(3) Roscomnadzor has publicly confirmed that the law will be applied to foreign companies too, as long as they are involved in the processing of personal data of Russian citizens.]

 

Federal Law No. 97-FZ, on Amending Federal Law “On Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information” and Other Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation Concerning Putting in Order Information Exchange Using Information and Telecommunication Networks, May 5, 2014 (aka ""Bloggers Law"")
 
(1) The law requires that bloggers (owners of sites with more than 3000 daily visitors)  refrain from using their blog for illegal activities, ensure correctness of published information, disclose their contact details, and comply with all applicable laws (electoral, mass media, privacy, defamation etc.).
 
(2) Roscomnadzor is authorized to maintain a register of bloggers and request from hosting providers, bloggers and any 3rd parties any information that is required for the purpose of maintaining the register. 
 
(3) The law also introduces a concept of “organizers of distribution of information” (ODI), which are defined as those who “enable the receipt, transmission, delivery and/or processing of electronic messages of Internet users.” The definition is quite broad and may well apply to all types of intermediaries.
 
(4) ODIs are required to notify Roscomnadzor before commencing the provision of services, retain and store in Russia certain user data for 6 months, disclose information to law enforcement authorities, and at the request of LEAs install wiretapping equipment.

Federal Law No. 398-FZ, on Amending Federal Law on Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection, December 28, 2013
 
[(1) The Law introduces new Article 15.3 to the Law “On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection” (see below), which sets out the conditions for blocking access to a web site that contains calls for unauthorized protest actions or extremist activities.
 
(2) According to the Law, Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecommunication, Information Technologies and Mass Communications), upon receiving an order from the Prosecutor General’s Office, can request that: (i) telecom operators block access for their users to this site with an immediate effect, and (ii) hosting provider of the site notifies the site owner of the alleged violation urging to remove the content.]

 
Federal Law No. 187-FZ, on Amending Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation Concerning the Questions of Protection of Intellectual Rights in Information and Telecommunication Networks, July 2, 2013 
 
[(1) The law sought to strengthen the protection of motion pictures online and  introduced amendments to the Civil Code, the Civil Procedure Code, the Arbitrazh (Commercial) Procedure Code, and the Federal Law No. 149-FZ of July 27, 2006 “On Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information.” It also introduced a general framework for intermediary liability for IP infringements (see more on art. 1253.1 of the Civil Code above).
 
(2) Under amended art. 26 of the Civil Procedural Code, the Moscow city court, as a court of first instance, has an exclusive jurisdiction to consider cases related to violation of IP rights to motion pictures on the Internet, and can issue preliminary injunctions at the request of a right holder before a legal suit is filed.
 
(3) Roscomnadzor is mandated to enforce such injunctions in accordance with the new article 15.2 of the Law “On Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information” by identifying hosting providers and requesting the removal of or limiting access to infringing material.
 
(4) If either a hosting service provider or content owner fail to take required measures, Roscomnadzor will issue an order to telecom operators to block access to an identified online service.
 
(5) Later, in November 2014 the list of protected copyright objects under this law was expanded to cover all copyright objects (except photos). See more below on Law No. 364-FZ.]
 

Federal Law No. 139-FZ, on the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development and Other Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation (aka “Blacklist law”), July 28, 2012
 
[(1) Positioned as means for the protection of children from harmful content that contains information about drug usage, advocates suicide or describes suicide methods, or contain child pornography, the law created a unified register of web sites that contain such information. The register is administered by the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications (Roscomnadzor). The law introduced a blocking mechanism of such sites (by adding a new article 15.1 to the Law “On Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information”): 
Upon identifying a site with illegal content, Roskomnadzor informs the website's owner and a respective hosting provider; 
If the content is not removed within three days, the website is then added to the register, which triggers a requirement for all Russian telecom operators to block an access to it; 
The law also sets forth a procedure for reinstating access to a site that later complied with Roscomnadzor’s request and removed illegal content. 
 
(2) Later, Federal Law No. 398-FZ “On Amending the Federal Law “On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection” of December 28, 2013 introduced a somewhat similar blocking algorithm in relation to sites with information containing calls for mass riots or extremist activities.
 
(3) As of today, the enforcement of these laws has demonstrated that they have extraterritorial reach and are applied both to local and foreign web sites.]
 
Part Four of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, December 18, 2006
 
[(1) Article 1253.1 of the Civil Code, introduced by Federal Law No. 187-FZ of July 2, 2013, defines “information intermediary” as “an entity that carries out the transmission of content through information and telecommunication networks, including on the Internet”, “an entity that enables the publication of content, or information required to access such content through information and telecommunication networks”, or “an entity that enables access to the content  through such information and telecommunication networks”. It is still to be seen whether information location tools, i.e. search engines, fall under the statutory definition of “information intermediary” too. 
 
(2) Information intermediaries are exempted from liability for IP infringement subject to the following conditions: 
Transmission: (a) did not initiate the transmission of the content and did not designate the recipient of the content; (b) did not modify the content while providing services, save for the changes necessary by the technical process of transmission; and (c) did not know, and should not know, that the use of intellectual property objects by a person that initiated the transmission was unlawful; 
Hosting and providing access: (a) did not know, and should not know, that the use of intellectual property objects was unlawful; (b) upon the receipt of a written notice from a right holder  promptly undertook necessary and sufficient measures, as may be set forth by law, to cease the violation of IP rights. 
 
(3) The limitations of the liability of information intermediaries under this article do not affect the right to seek injunctions, including the removal of infringing content, or the restricting access to it.
 
Constitution of the Russian Federation, December 12, 1993 [English version]

 

[Article 29. 
1. Everyone shall be guaranteed the freedom of ideas and speech.
2. The propaganda or agitation instigating social, racial, national or religious hatred and strife shall not be allowed. The propaganda of social, racial, national, religious or linguistic supremacy shall be banned.
3. No one may be forced to express his views and convictions or to reject them.
4. Everyone shall have the right to freely look for, receive, transmit, produce and distribute information by any legal way. The list of data comprising state secrets shall be determined by a federal law.
5. The freedom of mass communication shall be guaranteed. Censorship shall be banned.] 

 
Federal Law No. 149-FZ, on Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information , July 27, 2006
 
[(1) Article 17 of the Law establishes general principles of intermediary liability for distribution of illegal information (other than IP) by exempting intermediaries from civil liability subject to the following conditions: 
Transmission: did not modify the content while providing services.
Hosting and enabling access: could not know that the distribution of information was illegal.
 
(2) Hosting provider, telecom operator and web site owner are not liable to right holders and users for restricting access to information, if such restriction was implemented in accordance with this law.]
 
Federal Law No. 2121-1, on Mass Media, December 27, 1991
 

[(1) The law requires that ""mass media"" businesses be registered with the applicable governmental authority. The registration process is cumbersome and enables the government to exert direct and indirect pressure on a media outlet. Moreover, amendments to the law adopted in October 2014 limit non-Russian ownership and control, direct or indirect, of Russian mass media to no more than 20%. 
 
(2) Although it does not specifically include Internet service providers in the list of mass media businesses, there are some Internet businesses that were required to register. On the other hand, in 2014, the General Prosecutor's Office opined that Yandex.News (local news aggregator service) is not a mass media and is not required to be registered as such. 
 
(3) The law also allows websites to register on a voluntary basis as mass media under the procedures established by the law.]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts


Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, Deputy State Prosecutor for the Pskov Region v. Rostelecom, October 9, 2012
[website blocking, access provider, access to illegal information, online gambling]
 
[The Deputy State Prosecutor for the Pskov Region of Russia requested that Rostelecom, a telecom provider, block its clients from accessing Internet gambling websites. The Pskov City Court rejected the prosecutor’s claim and ruled that providing access to Internet gambling sites is not prohibited (even though Internet gambling itself is prohibited). The prosecutor appealed. In a landmark and a very worrying ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of access to illegal information is equal to its dissemination and thus should be prohibited. As a result, Rostelecom should block its users from accessing such information.] 
 
Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation, Kontent I Pravo v. Masterhost, December 23, 2008 
 
[In this case, Kontent I Pravo claimed that its rights to copyright objects, uploaded by third parties on the website that was hosted on servers provided by Masterhost, were violated. Masterhost argued that it only provided web hosting services and thus should not be liable for mere storage and transmission of the content. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Masterhost reasoning that a provider should not be liable if it does not initiate the transmission or modify the content.]

LEGISLATION


Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015
 
[(1) This Act offers possibly the widest safe harbour protection for ""online content hosts"".  The Act also establishes a civil regime in respect of digital communications that breach one or more of the ""Communication Principles"".  The Communication Principles have very low thresholds, and the civil regime is yet to come into full force.  The Act establishes criminal offences for causing serious emotional harm by posting a digital communication and for inciting, counselling or procuring another person to commit suicide – even if that other person does not commit or attempt to commit suicide in consequence of that conduct.  An online content host may be liable under these provisions if it fails to comply with the safe harbour procedure.
 
(2) This Act offers protection from all civil and criminal liability, (excepting four particular categories of liability), provided the online content host follows a notice-notice-takedown procedure in accordance with Section 24 of the Act.
 
(3) ""Online content host"" means the person who has control over the part of the electronic system, such as a website or an online application, on which a communication is posted and accessible by a user.  
 
(4) Although the protection from liability is wide, including tortious liability such as under defamation or breach of confidence, Section 25(4) expressly states that it does not protect the online content host from four specific types of liability: (i)  breaching criminal name suppression orders/laws (section 211 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011); (ii)  publishing certain details about bail hearings (section 19 of the Bail Act 2000); (iii)  copyright liability or any proceedings under the Copyright Act 1994; and (4)  any enactment that expressly overrides these safe harbour provisions.]
 

Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Regulations 2011
 
[(1) These regulations set out the matters that must be included in a ""rights owner notice"" to be sent from rights owners to IPAPs under Sections 122A to 122U of the Copyright Act 1994 (see below). Each rights owner notice must identify all the alleged infringements against the rights owner's copyright that occurred at a single IP address during a single day. These regulations also prescribe the information required in infringement notices (in addition to the requirements set out in the Copyright Act); and challenge notices (which are notices that an account holder may send to a rights owner, via an IPAP, to challenge an infringement notice).
 
(2) The regulations prescribe other procedural matters including the fee an IPAP may charge a rights owner; the fee for application to the Copyright Tribunal; the method of calculating an award under section 122O of the Copyright Act; and the requirement for the Tribunal to identify the various components of the award.]
 
Copyright Act 1994
 
[(1) A person who infringes copyright may face both civil and criminal proceedings under the Copyright Act.  (i) The Act contains exemptions from infringement liability for transient & incidental copying that is an integral or essential part of a technological process, provided the original copy was not an infringing copy. (ii) The Act also contains exemptions from liability for Internet Services Providers (ISPs) and Internet Protocol Address Providers (IPAPs), provided they comply with specified obligations. 
 
(2) An ISP is defined as any person who does either or both of the following:  (a) offers the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing; or (b) hosts material on websites or other electronic retrieval systems that can be accessed by a user (section 2).   Under Sections 92B to 92E, an ISP will not be liable for storing or caching infringing material unless the ISP:  (a) knows or has reason to believe that the material infringes copyright in the work; and (b) does not, as soon as possible after becoming aware of the infringing material, delete the material or prevent access to it (section 92C).   
 
(3) An IPAP is defined as a person that operates a business that, other than as an incidental feature of its main business activities: (a) offers the transmission, routing, and providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing; and (b) allocates IP addresses to its account holders; and (c) charges its account holders for its services; and (d) is not primarily operated to cater for transient users. 
 
(4) Sections 122A to 122U of the Act establish a process for copyright owners to follow when they consider an internet user has infringed their copyright via a file sharing network.  File-sharing networks are not illegal in themselves. However, much of the content on file-sharing networks is music, film, television, books or software that is protected by the Act.  A rights owner can make a claim against an internet account holder who the rights owner alleges has infringed copyright via file sharing.  Upon request by the rights owner, IPAPs must issue infringement notices to alleged infringers.  IPAPs also have administrative requirements under section 122T of the Act.  A failure to comply with these requirements could result in the ISP losing the protection from copyright liability under section 92B.]
 
Defamation Act 1992
 
[(1) The Act provides protection from defamation liability for innocent disseminators that have no actual knowledge of the defamatory content complained of (Section 21).  Any person who has published the matter that is the subject of defamation proceedings solely in the capacity of, or as the employee or agent of, a processor or a distributor, it is a defence if that person alleges and proves that:  (a) that person did not know that the matter contained the material that is alleged to be defamatory; and  (b) that person did not know that the matter was of a character likely to contain material of a defamatory nature; and  (c) that person's lack of knowledge was not due to any negligence on that person's part.
 
(2) Online content hosts may be protected from liability in defamation if they comply with the complaints provisions under the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (see above).]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Court of Appeal, Murray v Wishart [2014] 3 NZLR 722, [2014] NZCA 461, September 19, 2014
[defamation, Facebook page owner, publisher, third party statements, actual knowledge]
 
[(1) Wishart (Respondent) was the author of a book about Macsyna King. Wishart sought damages for defamation arising from comments by Murray made on a Facebook page established by Murray called ""Boycott the Macsyna King book""; Murray's Twitter account (linked to Facebook page); and during radio interviews.  
 
(2) An application to strike out was made in part on the basis Murray was not the publisher of third party statements on the Facebook page. Issues included whether HC Judge was correct in finding there was an arguable case that Murray was a publisher of third party statements on the webpage.
 
(3) Court of Appeal differed from view of HC Judge in central aspect of reasoning based on Emmens v Pottle (1885) 16 QBD 354. Emmens was not authority for the proposition that a person may be found to have published a defamatory statement on the ground that they ought to have known of its existence. Existing case law was of limited assistance: it is important to focus on the particular factual situation before the Court. The host's action, allegedly amounting to infringement by the setting up of the Facebook page, was more closely analogous to the notice on wall situation in Byrne v Dean [1937] 1 KB 818. Byrne v Deane, however, was distinguished in other respects. CA expressed concerns regarding applying the ""ought to know"" test to the host of a Facebook page. The actual knowledge test is consistent with Sadiq v Baycorp (NZ) (see below), A v Google New Zealand Ltd (see below) and Davison v Habeeb [2011] EWHC 3031 (QB), and conformed with the approach in Byrne v Deane and Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council [1991] Aust Torts Reports 81. The liability risk of a Facebook page host was no greater than that of an organiser of a public meeting.
 
(4) HELD:  Actual knowledge test should be the only test to determine whether a Facebook page host was a publisher - present pleading in respect of third party comments did not meet requirements of actual knowledge test - respondent permitted to re-plead claim]

 

Lower Courts


High Court, A v Google New Zealand Ltd [2012] NZHC 2352, 12 September 2012
[defamation, hosting provider, search engine, liability for search results, publisher]
 
[(1) Successful application by Google for defendant summary judgment; unsuccessful application for strike out by Google on basis Google was not a publisher; unsuccessful application for plaintiff summary judgment by A.  
 
(2) Case considered the responsibility of a search engine provider for the content of information on third party websites accessed from search results. When A's name was searched using www.google.co.nz, search results included reference to defamatory material, and a link to a third party website. A sought summary judgment on the basis that the information was clearly defamatory and that the defendant was aware of the search results. Google applied for summary judgment claiming that (i) its ultimate parent company (Google, Inc.) owned and operated the Google search engine and (ii) publication by a search engine provider of results of an enquiry did not amount to publication.  Court considered whether the defendant was a publisher of defamatory material. The test in Sadiq v Baycorp (NZ) Ltd for determining who was a publisher of defamatory material was applied (see below). The onus was on the defendant to provide enough evidence to satisfy the Court that the plaintiff's claim could not succeed.
 
(3) HELD:  The evidence supported that Google, Inc. owned and operated the Google search engine and domain name google.co.nz. The removal of references to offending webpages, following forwarding of correspondence by the defendant to Google, Inc., did not establish that the defendant had a legal ability to remove URLs from searches through the NZ domain name (applied Duffy v Google Inc [2011] SADC 178). Defendant was not liable for defamation because it had no relevant legal control over Google search engine results. The connection to Google, Inc. was not sufficient to meet the test in Sadiq. A did not have a reasonably arguable case, and it was otherwise a novel issue whether or not search engines were ""publishers"", therefore summary proceedings would have been inappropriate. It was unnecessary to consider the availability of defences in innocent dissemination and neutral reportage, application for strike out was dismissed on the grounds that this was a developing area of the law and it was arguable that the defendant was a publisher. Summary judgment awarded to Google against A.]
 
High Court, Sadiq v Baycorp (NZ) Ltd HC Auckland CIV-2007-404-6421, March 31, 2008
[defamation, hosting provider, credit reporting website, publishing, company acquisition, taken to have assumed responsability, actual knowledge, acts of promotion or ratification]
 
[(1) The plaintiff, Sadiq, issued defamation and negligence proceedings against two parties, arising out of allegedly defamatory statements published on a credit reporting website. The issue for determination was whether the first defendant, Baycorp (NZ) Ltd (Baycorp), published that material.  Baycorp sought summary judgment on the basis it had not published the material. The alleged facts said that another party, Baycorp Advantage Collection Services (New Zealand) Ltd (BACS), had posted the defamatory material on the website, prior to that company (and its website) being acquired by Baycorp.  Sadiq argued Baycorp had the means to, and should have, removed the material from the website after it had purchased BACS. 
 
(2) HELD:  The reasoning in Byrne and Urbanchich applied to online publication, and a defendant could not be taken to have assumed responsibility for defamatory material placed on its website by the previous owner of that website unless it knew about the material.  ""... there must be some action that amounts to a promotion of, or ratification of, the continuing presence of the defamatory material on the website"".  On the facts, summary judgment was denied, because it was arguable that Baycorp had determined whether such defamatory statements were to remain on the website or be removed. The Court applied the following test for determining liability: (ii)  Did Baycorp have knowledge of the defamatory statement? (ii)  Did Baycorp have the ability to end the publication of the defamatory statement? (iii)  Was Baycorp unwilling to end that publication thus allying itself with the defamatory statement?  If yes to all three, Baycorp would be liable.]

LEGISLATION


The Copyright Act of 1957, as amended by the Copyright (Amendment) Act 2012
 
[(1) The protection provided to intermediaries under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act (see below) is not available for offences under the Copyright Act of 1957 as amended by the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. 
 
(2) The Copyright Act was amended by the Copyright Amendment Act of 2012 and contains some provisions affecting the intermediaries. Section 52(b) of the act provides that transient or incidental storage of a work made in the technical process of electronic transmission or communication to the public shall not constitute copyright infringement. Further, Section 52(c) stipulates that transient and incidental storage of a work for the purpose of providing electronic links, access or integration, where such links, access or integration has not been expressly prohibited by the right holder, shall not constitute infringement, unless the intermediary has reasonable grounds for believing that such storage is of an infringing copy.
 
(3) However, the proviso to Section 52(1)(c) creates a notice and takedown procedure as it lays down that when a person responsible for storage (intermediary) gets a written notice from a rights holder claiming the storage to be infringement copyright, then it shall disable access for a period of 21 days; and if the right holder desires the takedown to stay beyond 21 days, then he must obtain a court order. Although, in case the rights holder fails to get a court order within twenty one days then the access can be restored. The procedure for notice and takedown is provided by Rule 75 of the Copyright Rules of 2013.]
 

Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 (to be read with Section 79 of the IT Act)
 
[(1) Setting up due diligence provisions to be observed by intermediaries while discharging their duties, including the publications of rules and regulations, privacy policy and user agreement for access-or usage of the intermediary's computer resources. 
 
(2) Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 lays down the due diligence standard that needs to be observed by the intermediary. The rules require the intermediaries publish rules and regulations, privacy policies and user agreement. These published terms and conditions or user agreement shall forbid the user from publishing any information that is grossly harmful, harassing, blasphemous defamatory, obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, libellous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically objectionable, disparaging, relating to or encouraging money laundering or gambling, harm minors in any way, impersonate another person, belongs to another person and to which the user does not have any right to or violates any law among other things. 
 
(3) Rule 3(4) creates a notice and takedown regime, where the intermediary was mandated to remove any such information mentioned above within 36 hours, either when it gets to know on its own or receives actual knowledge that such information is being stored, hosted or published on its computer system. However, the requirement of taking down content within 36 hours has since been clarified by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to mean that the intermediary should respond or acknowledge the complaint within thirty six hours of receiving it and should initiate appropriate action.] 
 
Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 (to be read with section 69A of the IT Act)
 
[(1) If the Government is of the view that it is necessary to block certain information 'generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource' it can direct the intermediaries to block access to such content. However, such blocking can only be ordered if it meets certain criteria have to be met which are laid down in clause (1) of section 69A. The section also mandated that the reasons for the blocking must be recorded in writing. Additionally, the section carries criminal penalties and intermediaries can be punished with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and are also liable to fine if do not comply with the requests.
 
(2) The detailed procedure for blocking access to any such information has been laid down in the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. Under the said rules, only ministries and agencies of the Central Government or any of the State or a Union Territory can ask for blocking access to the information. No individual can directly request for blocking of access to any content.
 
(3) All the requests received for blocking are examined by a committee consisting of the designated officer and representatives from the ministries of Law and Justice, Home Affairs and Information and Broadcasting and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) within seven days. The committee examines the request and determines whether it is covered under the grounds mentioned in Section 69A and provides recommendations. The recommendations are presented to the Secretary, Department of Technology who decides whether the information should be blocked or not. Rule 9 lays down the procedure for blocking in case of an emergency in which a decision needs to be taken without any delay.]
 

Information Technology Act 2000, as amended by the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008
 
[This statute came into force on and provided legal recognition for electronic commerce and gave effect to a resolution of the UN General Assembly. The statute was subsequently amended in 2008 along with the definition of intermediary and the provision for safe harbour for intermediaries provided under Section 79 of the IT Act. 
 

(1) Definition of Intermediary. An ‘Intermediary’ with respect to any particular electronic records is defined under Section 2(w) of the Information Technology Act as ‘any person who on behalf of another person receives, stores or transmits that record or provides any service with respect to that record and includes telecom service providers, network service providers, internet service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-marketplaces and cyber cafes.'

 
(2) Safe Harbour Provisions. Under Section 79 of the IT Act, intermediaries are exempted from liability in certain cases. Section 79 states that an intermediary shall not be liable:


Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force but subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), an intermediary shall not be liable for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hasted by him. 
The provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply if—(a) the function of the intermediary is limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hasted; or (b) the intermediary does not—(i) initiate the transmission, (ii) select the receiver of the transmission, and (iii) select or modify the information contained in the transmission; (c) the intermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties under this Act and also observes such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe in this behalf. 
The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply if—(a) the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced, whether by threats or promise or authorise in the commission of the unlawful act; (b) upon receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit the unlawful act, the intermediary fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material on that resource without vitiating the evidence in any manner. Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “third party information” means any information dealt with by an intermediary in his capacity as an intermediary.""]

 
(3) Data retention and intermediaries. According to Section 67C of the IT Act, intermediaries are required by law to ‘preserve and retain certain specified information for specific durations in a manner prescribed by the Central Government’. Any intermediary who intentionally or knowingly fails to retain such information shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.]
 


Administrative Regulations

Regulatory Entity: Committee ex Rule 7 of the IT Rules, 2009
 
[A committee consisting of the designated officer and representatives from the ministries of Law and Justice, Home Affairs and Information and Broadcasting and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) examines within seven days all the request received for blocking access to online information according to Section 69(A)(1) of the IT Act (see above). Section 69A of the IT act provides the government with the ""power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource [ . . . ] [w]here the Central Government or any of its officers specially authorised by it in this behalf is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above."" (See also ""Supreme Court, Shreya Singhal v. Union of India"" below.)] 



DECISIONS


Superior Courts

Supreme Court, Criminal, Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, No. 167/2012, March 24, 2015
[online speech, freedom of expression, dangerous speech, hate speech, IT Act, Intermediaries Guidelines, constitutionality]
 
[(1) The Supreme Court of India issued a landmark decision regarding the constitutionality of several provisions included in the Indian Information Technology Act (""IT Act""). The provisions dealt with content removal online and blocking orders. According to the Supreme Court, vague standards for blocking and removing content online are unconstitutional. Additionally, content blocking must be mandated only by a reasoned order from a judicial, administrative or governmental body and must be transparent.
 
(2) The case was brought before the Supreme Court by two young ladies arrested by the police for posting on a social networking site critical comments about a city shutdown. Actually, one of these two young women just reinforced the original comment by ""liking"" it.
 
(3) First, the Indian Supreme Court struck down provisions heavily censoring online speech through the implementation of amorphous and overbroad standards. Specifically, the Court declared Section 66A of the Information Technology Act as unconstitutional. Section 66A allowed both criminal charges against users and the removal of content by intermediaries based on allegations that the content was “grossly offensive or has menacing character”, or that false information was posted “for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will."" The Court noted that Section 66A did not qualify as a reasonable restriction on freedom of expression by being vaguely worded and allowing misuse by the police.
 
(4) Second, the Supreme Court construed Section 79 of the IT Act in such a manner that removal of content online may only occur if an adjudicatory body issues an order compelling intermediaries to remove the content. Section 79 of the IT Act provided that safe harbors from liability for online intermediaries could be suspended if the intermediary fails to take down content upon “receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit [an] unlawful act”. The Supreme Court interpretation of Section 79 shields intermediaries from liability unless they fail to comply with an order directing them to remove the illegal content, rather than merely a private party request.
 
(5) The judgment still maintains in place Section 69A of the IT act that provides the government with the ""power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource [ . . . ] [w]here the Central Government or any of its officers specially authorised by it in this behalf is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above."" 
 
(6) Finally, the court stated that transparency standards should apply to blocking orders and all website blocking orders should be made public.] [See also CIS Blog]

Supreme Court, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (pending)
[IT Act, Intermediaries Guidelines, Constitutionality, Freedom of Expression]
 
[Peoples' Union for Civil Liberties has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court of India arguing that Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 and the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 are in violation of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.]
 

Lower Courts


High Court of Gujarat, Vyas v. Gujarat, No. 191/2015, September 15, 2015
[freedom of expression, dangerous speech, public order, access providers, blocking order]
 
[(1) In response to public protests and agitations, the State of Gujarat, India blocked Internet access through mobile phones for a week pursuant to Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 
(2) Petitioner Gaurav Sureshbhai  Vyas brought the present public interest litigation before the High Court of Gujarat, seeking to declare that the state lacked authority to block Internet access under Section 144 and argued that such blockage violates Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.
 
(3) The High Court of Gujarat held that the temporary ban on Internet through mobile phone services was permissible though the invocation of Section 144 as the state government had sufficient justification to prevent public disturbance and maintain public order. The Court further noted that a ban on Internet access may not be considered a per se violation of the right to freedom of expression if such restriction is ""minimal."" According to the Court, Gujarat's ban was a minimal restriction as access to Internet through broadband and Wi-Fi services was still permitted.] [See also Columbia GFE]
 
High Court of Delhi, Vinay Rai v. Google et al, 2012
[objectionable content, obscene content, dangerous speech, users' platforms, website blocking, criminal conspiracy]
 
[Summoned executives from Google, Facebook, Twitter and other companies to remove objectionable content from their website within the prescribed time period failing to which may result into blocking of the websites in India and the executives facing trial for criminal conspiracy. The case centred on a petition filed by a journalist named Vinay Rai, who referred to obscene depictions online of Jesus Christ, the Prophet Mohammed, and various Hindu deities. Charges against the intermediaries included ""promoting enmity between groups""  and ""deliberate malicious acts intended to outrage.""]

Self-Regulation


Belgian Internet Service Providers Association Code of Conduct
 
[This is the Code of conduct set up by ISPA, the Belgian Association of Internet service providers. This Code of conduct is a example of self-regulation. It is mandatory for all the members of ISPA. It binds the members to a set of obligations, including the obligation for all the Belgian ISPs to collaborate adequately with the judicial authorities in their fight against online crimes, including copyright infringments, also through the Central Judicial Contact Point or eCops (see below).]
 
Protocol of Cooperation between ISPs and Judicial Authorities
 
[This April 1999 Protocol of cooperation between ISPA (the Belgian ISP Association), the police and judicial authorities was agreed upon to improve the cooperation between Belgian ISPs and judicial authorities. The Protocol put in place a Central Judicial Contact Point, which is now eCops, available at www.ecops.be). eCops is an online complaint department to which Internet users, as well as the ISPs, can report crimes (including copyright infringments) committed through the Internet.]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts



Supreme Court, Criminal, Belgacom SA/NV & Scarlet SA/NV (The Pirate Bay case II), P.13.0551.N/1, October 22, 2013
[Belgium, copyright, access providers, file sharing, torrent, The Pirate Bay, blocking order]
 
[(1) Reversing the decision of the Anvers Court of Appeal of February, 14 2013, ordering the blockage of all the websites redirecting to ""thepiratebay.org,"" and sending the case back to the Brussels Court of Appeal.
 
(2) The Belgian Supreme Court confirmed that the public prosecutor did not violate the law by ordering the ISPs to block all websites redirecting to thepiratebay.org. The Court confirmed that far-reaching blocking orders against all national Internet service providers are lawful. According to the Supreme Court, a magistrate is entitled to order, (i) in a single injunction, (ii) all national Internet service providers to (iii) block access to IP rights-infringing content (iv) which is hosted by a server, linked to a specific main domain name, (v) by employing all possible technical means at their disposal or at least by blocking all domain names that refer to a specified main domain name. 
 
(3) This injunction, the Court noted, did not impose on the ISPs an unlawful obligation to monitor the web, which would be contrary to Art. 15 of the e-commerce Directive. According to the Supreme Court, this order does not trequire the ISPs to (i) monitor the information they transmit or store or (ii) actively seek facts or circumstances evidencing illegal activities.
 
(4) In dismissing the grivances of the plaintiffs, three ISPs (Telenet, Tecteo and Brutele) in this case, the Supreme court refused to refer a number of questions to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested to refer to the ECJ whether the Court of Appeal violated Eu law in failing (i) to specify the particular means they had to employ to comply with the injunction order and (ii) to exhaustively list the domain names to be blocked. However, the first question was later decided by the ECJ in the Telekabel case.]
 
Supreme Court, Civil, H.L. v. Test-Achats SCRL, C.10.0153.F/1, June, 16 2011
[copyright, privacy, personal information, infringment, hosting provider]
 

[The Belgian Supreme Court upheld an appelate decision holding that it is not possible for rightsholders or any other interested party to obtain from an hosting provider certain information to identify alleged copyright infringers on the basis of Article 21, § 2 of the Law of March 11, 2003 on certain services of the information society. This provision only allows judicial or administrative authorities to obtain these information (name of the client, his geographical situation, etc.) from a hosting provider in order to look for possible violation of the Law.] 
 
Supreme Court, Criminal, R.V., P.03.1427.N/1, February 3, 2004
[copyright, hosting providers, hyperlinks, ecommerce directive, exemptions, safe harbours]
 
[The Supreme Court reviewed the application of the exemptions from liability established in the e-commerce Directive, as implemented by Article 20 of Law of March, 11 2003 related to certain aspects of services of the information society. The exemptions would cover over only cases where the activity of the information society service provider is (i) limited to the technical process of operating and giving access to a communication network (ii) over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored, (iii) for the sole purpose of making the transmission more efficient. (iv) This activity must be of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature, which implies that the information society service provider has neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is transmitted or stored. In the case at hand, the operator managed a website where third parties with his assistance could post unlawful hyperlinks. The Court stated that no safe harbour exemptions applied to this case.] 

 


Lower Courts



Brussels Court of Appeal, Belgian State v. SABAM, No. 2015/AR/810, June 3, 2016
[copyright, ISP, CMO, fee for online transmission, rejected]
 
[confirming the March 13, 2015 judgment of the Brussels Court of First Instance (see below) and restating that there is no legal basis for SABAM to seek the collection of royalties from ISPs for alleged (unauthorized) communication to the  public of works in SABAM's repertoire.]
 
Brussels Court of First Instance, Belgian Privacy Authority v. Facebook, No. 15/57/C, November 9, 2015
[privacy, data protection, hosting provider, tracking, non-users, social plugins]
 
[TheCourt found that Facebook’s practice of tracking non-users of Facebook’s surfing history through social plugins, even when the user was not accessing Facebook, violated the Belgian Data Protection Law. The proceeding follows a formal recommendation from the Belgian Privacy Commission requesting Facebook to cease the tracking of non-users. The court imposed a penalty of EUR 250,000 per day for non-compliance.] [See also Columbia GFE and  here]
 
Brussels Court of First Instance, Civil, Belgian State v. SABAM, No. 13/12839/A, March 13, 2015
[copyright, ISP, CMO, fee for online transmission, rejected]
 
[(1) SABAM, the largest Belgian collective management organisation (CMO), sought to obtain the payment of a copyright levy from Belgian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for communicating to the public its repertoire. SABAM claimed that ISPs communicate to the public its repertoire without authorisation. SABAM demanded 3.4 percent of the ISPs' annual user subscription fees as a compensation for piracy  committed by the ISPs' users. 
 
(2) As requested by law, SABAM informed the Economic Federal Public Service (SPF Economie), the administrative authority in charge of overseeing CMOs' activities, about its request to the ISPs. The SPF Economie issued a negative opinion regarding SABAM's proposed levy. After some inconclusive negotiations and an initial action started by SABAM against the ISPs but rejected on procedural grounds, the Belgian Administration brought an action against SABAM before the Court of Brussels for obtaining a judgment declaring the new levy illegal.
 

(3) The Brussels Court of First Instance ruled that the demand of SABAM was contrary to the present legislation. The Court noted that ISPs are neutral internet intermediaries with a passive and technical role and do not communicate to the public SABAM's repertoire. According to the EU e-Commerce Directive, ISPs are classified as mere conduits that are not liable for the information they transmit. SABAM is considering whether to appeal this decision.] [See also CIS Blog]


 
Anvers Court of Appeal, Criminal, Belgacom SA/NV, Scarlet Belgium SA/NV, Edpnet SA/NV & Mobistar SA/NV (The Pirate Bay case II), No. K.379/13 / 2013/697, February, 14 2013
[copyright, access providers, file sharing, torrent, The Pirate Bay, blocking order]
 
[Upholding the request of issuing a permanent blocking order for the primary domain name “thepiratebay.org” and other domain names redirecting to this primary domain name. This criminal proceeding was initiated by a public prosecutor after additional domain names directing to ThePirateBay website, other than those blocked under the civil ruling of September 26, 2011, were registered and put back online. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision issued by the court of first instance. The district court decision upheld a preliminary injunction ordering that all the Belgian Internet operators and distributors must block access to the content hosted by servers linked to the primary domain name ""thepiratebay.org"" and their IP address 194.71.107.50 and 194.71.107.15, in particular ""by employing all possible technical means at their disposal or at least by blocking all domain names that refer to the server linked to thepiratebay.org.“ The order did not contain any exhaustive list of domain names to be blocked or a time restriction.]
 
Anvers Court of Appeal, Civil, The Belgian Anti-piracy federation ASBL/VZW v. Telenet SA/NV & Belgacom SA/NV (“The Pirate Bay case I), No. 3399/Rep. 2011/9314, September, 26 2011
[Belgium, copyright, access providers, file sharing, torrent, The Pirate Bay, blocking order]
 
[Reversing the decision of the Anvers Court of First Instance of July, 8 2010 and ordering Belgian ISPs, Telenet and Belgacom, to block DNS extensions for 11 domain names related to ThePirateBay. The Court clarified that ISPs do not themselves infringe copyright and are not liable for the content transmitting though their services. However, the safe harbours included in the e-commerce Directive do not prevent the court to order them to block infringing webistes, if, according to Article 8.2 of the Infosoc Directive ""their services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or a related right."" These blocking orders, the Court continued, do not impose on the ISPs a general obligation to monitor the information that they transmit because the injunction only concerns a number of exhaustively mentioned domain names. The Court specifically rejected the plaintiff's request to extend the injunction to any other ThePirateBay related website that the plaintiff may have reported to the ISPs.]
 

Brussels Court of Appeal, Civil, Scarlet Extended SA/NV v. SABAM (“The Tiscali/Scarlet case”), R.G. 2007/AR/2424, January 1, 2010
[copyright, infringment, access provider, file sharing, p2p, filtering, monitoring]
 
[The Court of Appeal of Brussels had to answer the question whether an internet service provider could be required to install a filtering system with a view to preventing the illegal downloading of files. The Court had to consider the extent to which Internet service providers should support the operational and financial burden of the fight against piracy. Given the complexity of the matter, the Brussels Court of Appeal decided to refer two questions to the ECJ before deciding: (1) Can ISPs be compelled to take preventive technical measures in order to prevent illegal downloading? (2) If yes, to what extent technical and financial burdens can be imposed on them? See also the ECJ's Scarlet Extended judgment.] 

 

Anvers Court of First Instance, Civil, The Belgian Anti-piracy federation ASBL/VZW v. Telenet SA/NV & Belgacom SA/NV (The Pirate Bay case I), No. A/10/5374, July 8, 2010 
[copyright, access providers, file sharing, torrent, The Pirate Bay, blocking order]
 
[The Court rejected the request of blocking eight ""ThePirateBay"" websites and other “ThePirateBay” websites extensions. The request was filed against two of the biggest Belgian Internet providers, Telenet and Belgacom. The Court rejected the request by arguing that ThePirateBay was online for a long time without a judicial reaction of the Belgian Anti-Piracy Federation (BAPF), and it was unclear which rights BAPF claimed to have been infringed.]
 

Brussels Court of First Instance, Civil, SABAM v. Scarlet SA/NV (“The Tiscali/Scarlet case”), 04/8975A, June 29, 2007
[copyright, infringment, access provider, file sharing, p2p, filtering, monitoring]
 
[In its report filed January, 3 2007, the expert witness presented 11 solutions that can be applied to block or filter file sharing, including 7 applicable to Scarlet/Tiscali. On the basis of this report and the submissions of the parties, the Court ruled that technical solutions do exist to stop copyright infringements of music files via P2P file sharing. Accordingly, the Court ordered Scarlet to implement such measures to prevent future damage, within a period of time of six months and under a penalty of a fine of 2,500 euros per day of violation. Scarlet was also ordered to provide SABAM a description of the measures taken.]
 

Brussels Court of First Instance, Civil, SABAM v. Tiscali SA/NV (“The Tiscali/Scarlet case”), 04/8975A, November, 26 2004]
[copyright, infringment, access provider, file sharing, p2p, filtering, monitoring]
 
[(1) The Court had to answer the question whether an internet service provider could be required to install a filtering system with a view to preventing the illegal downloading of files. (2) The Court confirmed the possibility of introducing an injunction based on copyright infringement against an access provider even if said provider can benefit from the liability exemption regime provided for in the eCommerce Directive. The injunction does not presuppose any prior finding of fault, and therefore liability, on the part of the intermediary. (3) However, if the theoretical possibility of a blocking order against ISPs was confirmed, it remained to be seen if the provider has, in fact, the material possibility to comply with such an order. The Court ordered an expert testimony on this subject and the reopening of the debate (see above).]

BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

Cybercrime project (abandoned), Federal Department of Justice and Police
 
[Between 2001 and 2008, the federal government examined the opportunity to propose new rules governing the criminal liability of ISPs. However, it came to the conclusion that the current regulatory framework is appropriate to efficiently fight against criminal activities over the Internet. In addition, new rules would face the risk of being too rapidly outdated given the fast development of technologies in this sector. Also, the creation of immunities may inadequately serve the interests of ISPs by freeing them excessively from their liability.]
 
AGUR 12, Federal Department of Justice and Police & Federal Institute of Intellectual Property
 
[AGUR 12 is a working group created in 2012 by the Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga, Head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police, and under the supervision of the Director General of the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, Roland Grossenbacher. The working group is responsible for identifying the possibilities that exist for adapting copyright law to technical developments. The group recently issued its report and recommended, among others, the adoption of a takedown procedure (if possible through self-regulation) as well as of a system to block access via ISPs in serious copyright infringement cases (see link to proposals here).]
DECISIONS


Superior Courts

Federal Supreme Court, Civil, Tribune de Genève case, 5A_792/2011, January 14, 2013
[infringement of personality rights, civil liability for blog hosting]
 
[In the so-called Tribune de Genève case, the Swiss Supreme Court held that a newspaper is civilly liable (Article 28 of the Swiss civil code) when it hosts on its website the blog of a user whose content infringes on the personality rights of a third party. According to the Supreme Court, this liability is justified by the fact that the newspaper contributes to the diffusion of the infringing content to the public and a large circle of readers. The entity hosting the blog can be ordered to eliminate infringing contents on personality rights. Furthermore: (1) The Swiss Supreme Court explicitly clarified that the liability incurred by the infringement of personality rights is not related to the control over the infringing content. Put differently, since this type of liability does not require any fault (wilful intent or negligence), the question whether the ISP has control over the content posted in the blog or not is irrelevant. (2) The Swiss Supreme Court stated that ISPs will not face increasing actions for compensation as a result of this judgment because such actions typically require the demonstration of fault. (3) The Swiss Supreme Court considered that, in any event, serious consequences for ISPs that would result from the application of the existing law should not be fixed by the judiciary but by the legislature.

[The High Court of Paris ordered ISPs to “implement all necessary measures to prevent access from the French territory to the music file-sharing site the Pirate Bay and its redirection sites and mirror sites.” The French Court acted upon a claim of the Société Civile des Producteurs Phonographiques [Civil Society of Phonogram Producers] (SCPP). he blocking order was issued on the basis of Article L336-2 of the French Code of Intellectual Property. The article implements Article 8(3) of the EU Information Society Directive by providing that “in the presence of an infringement of a copyright or related right caused by the content of a public online communication service, the high court [ . . . ] may order at the request of rights holders [ . . . ] all appropriate measures to prevent or stop such infringement of a copyright or related right, against anyone who might help to find a remedy to the infringement.” To enhance its effectiveness, the order covers also a list of specifically enumerated redirection sites, mirror site, and proxies.]

LEGISLATION

Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, October 10, 1988 [English Version]
[Article 5, items IX, X and XII]
[Relevant Subject Matter: Freedom of Speech, Right to Privacy, Intimacy and Image, Liability for Material and Moral Damages]
 
Marco Civil da Internet - “Brazilian Internet Bill of Rights,"" Federal Law no. 12.965, April 23, 2014 [English version]
[Articles18-21 and others]
[Intermediary Liability, Safe-harbor, Data Privacy, Data Retention, Network Neutrality and others]
 
[The law introduces a liability exemption for Internet connection providers and the application of the safe harbor doctrine for other Internet application providers. Article 18 addresses the liability of Internet connection providers, grants an exception to those services regarding intermediary liability. It states that “the Internet connection provider shall not be subject to civil liability for content generated by third party”. Article 19, which addresses Internet application providers (excluding connection providers) states that, “in order to ensure freedom of expression and to prevent censorship, an Internet application provider shall only be subject to civil liability for damages caused by virtue of content generated by third parties if, after specific court order, it does not take action, according to the framework and technical limits of its services and within the time-frame ordered, to make the infringing content unavailable.” For a literal interpretation of the law, neither the responsibility exemption to ICPs nor the safe harbor doctrine to ISPs would apply to criminal liability.]
 
Brazilian Civil Code, Federal Law no. 10.406, January 10, 2002
[Articles 20, 21, 186, 187 and 927]
[Right to Privacy, Reputation and General Civil Liability for Damages]

 
[When the underlying relation does not regard consumer law (see below), the applicable law regarding civil intermediary liability is the Civil Code. This legislation institutes the core principles and provisions of tort law in Brazil. Article 186 provides for a classic Aquilian liability, and states that “he who, by voluntary action or omission, negligence or recklessness, violates rights and harm others, even if exclusively moral damages occur, commits an unlawful act.” Article 187 expands liability and provides legal basis for strict liability, stating that “also commits an unlawful act the holder of a right in which exercise clearly exceeds the limits imposed by their economic or social order, the good faith or morals.” Atricle 927, finally, institutes that “he who, by an unlawful act (arts. 186 e 187), causes damage to another, is obliged to repair it.” It is noteworthy that although there is no doctrine of vicarious liability in Brazil, the provisions on joint strict liability might be used to the same effect. As with civil liability, there is no specific legislation in Brazil regarding criminal intermediary liability. Some crimes, however, either specifically addresses acts of intermediary parties or has such open-ended elements that parties responsible for Internet Service Providers may subject to criminal charges.]

 
Elections Regulation Law, Federal Law no. 9.504, September 30, 1997
[Articles 36, 36-A, 41 §2, 43, 57-A, 57-B, 57-C, 57-D, 57-E, 57-F and 57-I]
[Electoral Propaganda Over the Internet, Free Speech, Censorship, Right of Honor and Image, Right to Respond, Takedown Orders, Access Blocking and Penalties]
 
Brazilian Consumer Defense Code, Federal Law no. 8.078, September 11, 1990 [English version]
[Articles 3, 14, 17 and 43, §2]
[Consumer Relationship, Strict Liability of Product/Service Suppliers and Data Retention]
 
[The Consumer Protection and Defense Code, which application should prevail over the Civil Code by virtue of the principle of lex specialis, defines supplier, on its Section 3, as “any individual or legal entity, either public or private, Brazilian or foreign, as well as depersonalized beings, that develop activities of production, assembly, creation, construction, transformation, importation, exportation, distribution or marketing of products or service provision.” By means of its activities, service providers are considered suppliers by virtue of Brazilian law, thus being regulated by that Code. Article 18 of the Code states that all suppliers involved in the chain of supply are jointly liable to compensate consumers for flaws in products and damages thereof. Hence, ISPs involved in the supply of products may be prosecuted for any vice regarding products in which sale they are involved. Liability in cases of provision of services is regulated by Sections 14 and 20 of the Code. Article 14 addresses liability for suppliers for the provision of services that harm or pose risk to consumers' health or safety, whereas Article 20 addresses general liability for vice on a service. In both provisions only direct liability is instituted. However, courts occasionally overlook the distinction and rule that all suppliers involved in the chain of supply of faulty services are jointly liable, by strict liability, also in such cases.]
 

Statute of Children and Adolescents, Federal Law no. 8.069, 1990
[Article 241-A]
[Child Pornography, Legal guardians, ISPs, Liability, Notice and Take Down]
 
[The crime described in Article 241-A specifies as crime the activity of legal guardians of Internet Service Providers regarding pornography involving children or adolescents, but conditions liability to failure of takedown upon notice: “Article 241-A. Offer, exchange, provide, transmit, distribute, publish or disclose by any means, including by computer or telematic system, photography, video, or other record containing explicit sex scenes or pornography involving a child or adolescent. Penalty - imprisonment of three (3) to six (6) years and a fine. §1 The same penalties apply to those who: I - ensures the means or services for storing pictures, scenes or images referred to in this article; II - secures, by any means, the access by means of a network of computers to photographs, scenes or images of the caput of this article. §2 The behaviors described in sections I and II of §1 of this Article shall be punishable when the legal guardian for the service has been officially notified, but still fails to disable access to the illegal content referred to in this article.” No other crimes specifically address intermediary liability, although they still may occur to Internet Service Providers by virtue of direct liability.]
 

Brazilian Criminal Code, Federal Decree-Law no. 2.848, December 7, 1940
[Article138, 139, 140, 154-A and 359]
[Libel, Defamation, Slander, Online Trespassing, Data Theft and Contempt of Court]
[Article 184]
[Criminal Copyright Infringement]
 
[The Article 184 of the Criminal Code regards violation of copyright, which constitutes as crime making available to the public copyrighted work, by electronic means, without proper authorization. This provision was revised in 2003. “Article 184 . Violate copyright and its related rights. Penalty - imprisonment of three (3) months to one (1) year or a fine. §1 If the violation consists in total or partial reproduction, in order to profit directly or indirectly, by any means or process, of intellectual work, performance or phonogram, without express permission from the author, performer, producer, as appropriate, or whom he represents. Penalty - imprisonment of two (2) to four (4) years and a fine. §2 The same penalty of §1 applies to whom, for the purpose of direct or indirect profit, distributes, sells, offers for sale, rents, introduces the country, acquires, conceals, maintains on deposit, original or copy of intellectual work or phonogram reproduced in violation of copyright law, of the right of the performer or the right of the producer of a phonogram, or rents the original or copy of intellectual work or phonogram, without the express permission from the rights holders or whom he represents. §3 If the violation consists in making available to the public by cable, fiber optic, satellite, waves or any other system that allows the user to select a work or production to receive it at a time and place previously determined by who demands it, in order to profit, directly or indirectly, without express authorization, as appropriate, from the author, performer, producer of a phonogram, or whom represents: Penalty - imprisonment of two (2) to four (4) years and a fine. §4 The provisions of §§1, 2 and 3 shall neither apply in the case of exception or limitation to copyright or that are related in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 9,610, of February 19, 1998, nor in case copying of intellectual work or phonogram, in a single copy for private use of the copyist, with no intention of direct or indirect profit.” Although this provision creates an exception regarding free and fair uses, it does not include any specific safe harbor provision. Hence, it depends on safe harbor provisions constituting such acts as fair use for it to be considered a legal safeguard.]

BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

Copyright Law Reform Bill, Federal Bill,  Bill nº 3133/2012, 2012
 
[In the current text there is no provision regarding intermediary liability. A few scholars who had access to a draft of the proposed changes to the bill have commented that a system of notice and takedown might be included in a future version of the bill. This system would be very similar to the DMCA, and, as one specific scholar stated, it ignores professor Jerome Reichman's proposal for a reverse notice and takedown regime, for what it has been criticized.]

DECISIONS

[As opposed to common law countries, where published court opinions usually have a binding effect on future cases, Brazil is a civil law based country, meaning that the decisions issued by its several courts have only a persuasive value. Nonetheless, decisions issued by high courts such as the Superior Court tend to create a logical pattern of legal interpretations for lower courts. Nonetheless, it is important to note that, as mentioned above, Brazil has just recently enacted its new Internet Bill of Rights, known as “Marco Civil da Internet”. The new law, which establishes rules on net neutrality, privacy, data retention and intermediary liability, amongst other issues, will become effective on the end of June, 2014, 60 days after its official publication held on April 24, 2014. The decisions quoted below, evidently, were issued based on the so-far-existing legal scenario, without encompassing the principles established by the new, soon to become effective law.]
 

Superior Courts

Superior Court of Justice, Orkut (Google Brasil Internet LTDA), Special Appeal No. 1512647/MG (2013/0162883-2), May 13, 2015
[copyright, hosting provider, Orkut, user-generated content, linking] 
 
[The Court ruled that content providers cannot be held liable for copyright violations committed by third parties in a case regarding whether the social networking site Orkut was responsible for copyright infringing user-generated content on its site. The Court ruled that Orkut’s does not profit from copyright infringement on the part of its users. The Court also ruled that Orkut could not be held responsible for links that users post to other pages containing copyright infringing material.] [See also CIS blog post.]
 
Superior Court of Justice, Fourth Panel, Google Brazil v. Dafra, Special Appeal No. 1306157/SP, March 24, 2014
[copyright, video-sharing, YouTube, technical capability, takedown, precise indication of URL] 
 
[Decision held that the ISP is liable for not acting to takedown all copies of a video (parodying a commercial of the motorbike company Dafra) that was uploaded several times by multiple users, regardless if there was not a precise URL indication of such videos. In particular, the SCJ noted that ""(…) this special appeal is limited to the remaining obligation regarding those videos that contain the insulting title, whether they have been precisely appointed by the authors (with the mention of the URL's), or not, so long as they exist on the site with that precise ‘title’, and, after the provider has been formally notified of their existence. […] there is reference about an expert testimony in the case records in which it was verified by the technical feasibility of controlling videos on YouTube, having the Court Expert concluded that such control is not exercised by the ISP due to issues related to convenience and opportunity. […] given the facts of the case, and, considering the precision of the content of the video indicated and the existence of an expert testimony suggesting  that it is possible for the site administrator to conduct searches – (this court) reiterates its understanding that the ISP, even at an injunction stance, must remove the defamatory content generated by its users, regardless of the precise indication of the URL by the offended party.""] [See also CIS blog]
 
Superior Electoral Court, Twitter Brazil, Special Electoral Appeal No. 74-64.2012.6.20.0003, September 12, 2013
[electoral propaganda, free speech and intellectual liberty, social network, Twitter, ]
 
[Decision held that Twitter Posts (Tweets) are not to be interpreted as anticipated electoral propaganda, even if the tweets contain electoral content or political opinion (according to Federal Law no. 9.504, electoral propaganda over the Internet is forbidden before July 5th of the year in which the election takes place). In this case, the Court noted “(…) Twitter consists of a conversation between people, and, usually, this communication is restricted to their bonds of friendship and persons authorized by the user."" Therefore, ""[p]reventing the disclosure of a thought or opinion, even those with electoral content during the constraint-period provided by the electoral law, in a delimited social network like Twitter, is to prevent someone to speak with others. This prohibition implies violation of freedom of thought and speech.""]
 
Superior Court of Justice, Third Panel, Google Brazil, Special Appeal No. 1323754/RJ, August 28, 2012
[social network, Orkut, moral damages, personal offense, notice and takedown]
 
[Decision held that the ISP must act expeditiously upon user notification in order to avoid being held jointly liable for offensive/illegal content. The decision suggests that, once communicated by a user that certain content has offensive and/or unlawful material, the ISP must act in 24 hours to momentarily takedown such content, for later analysis. In particular, the Brazilian Supreme Court noted that ""[o]nce notified that a certain text or picture has illegal content, the ISP must takedown the content within (twenty four) hours, to avoid the penalty of being held jointly liable with the offender due to omission.  In this 24 hours period, the ISP is not obliged to review the content indicated in the notice, but only to preventively suspend the webpages until it has enough time to assess the veracity of the allegations [ . . . ] Although this procedure may possibly violate the rights of those users whose pages may be improperly suspended, albeit temporarily, this violation of rights must be confronted with the damages arising out of the exposure resulting from the insults, being certain that, when weighing the losses involved, the balance indisputably tilts to the side of protecting the dignity and honor of those users that access the Internet . . . .""]
 

Superior Court of Brazil, Civil, Google Brasil Internet LTDA. vs. Maria da Graça Xuxa Meneghel, Special Appeal No. 1.316.921 - RJ  (2011⁄0307909-6), June 30, 2012
[Civil and Consumer law. Internet. Consumer relations. Applicability of the Consumer Protection and Defense Code. Irrelevance of gratuity of service. Internet search engine. Lack of necessity to prior filtering of the searches. Non-applicability of restrictions to the results. Public content. Right to information.] (Translated from the original by Felipe Busnello)
 
[Maria da Graça Xuxa Meneghel is a famous television show host in Brazil, who has made a notorious career in hosting shows aimed for children, and is widely known by the moniker “raínha dos baixinhos”, which translates to “queen of the little ones”. Prior to becoming famous for her television shows, she played a part in a Brazilian film titled “Amor Estranho Amor” (Love Strange Love). The movie is about the son of a luxurious prostitute (the latter played by the plaintiff), who revisits the brothel where he has met his mother as a 12 years-old teenager, and with whom he has discovered his own sexuality. The movie was somewhat unknown to the general public until references to it and copies of it started went viral on the Internet. Most of the copies had the two scenes in which the character played by Xuxa molests her teenager son deleted, as a result of thorough work by her public relations agents, but some original copies still existed and were circulated on the Internet. Xuxa sued Google Brasil Internet LTDA for the removal of any results that matched her name and the term “pedophile” or any related term, but had been denied her plea in all instances of court.]
 
Superior Court of Brazil, Civil, Google Brasil Internet LTDA, Special Appeal No. 1.186.616 – MG (2010/0051226-3), Agust 31, 2011
[Civil and Consumer law. Internet. Consumer relations. Applicability of the Consumer Protection and Defense Code. Irrelevance of gratuity of service. Internet Content Provider. Lack of duty of prior fiscalization of user generated content. Offensive content warning. Lack of inherent risk to the enterprise. Duty of immediate takedown upon knowledge of infringing material. Duty of identification of every user. Sufficiency of IP number.] (Translated from the original by Felipe Busnello)
 


Lower Courts


Supremo Tribunal Federal [State Court of Appeals], Civil, Aliandra v. Orkut, ARE 660861, April 9, 2012
[defamation, hosting provider, online communities, Orkut, notice and take-down]
 
[(1) The Plaintiff, a teacher called Aliandra, was informed by students that Orkut hosted an allegedly defamatory ""community"" (a discussion forum created by users) called “I hate Aliandra"". The teacher claims this community harmed her reputation. She notified Google and request the community to be taken down. Google replied that the content could not amount to defamation and that a court order would be required to take the content down.
 
(2) The Plaintiff filed the lawsuit and requested a) an injunction to take down the community and b) damages to be paid by Google for hosting the content. Her injunction request was denied, so the community remained online. Google presented its defense.
 
(3) Upon trial, the District Court of Minas Gerais (Tribunal de Justiça de Minas Gerais) decided the content was indeed defamatory and ordered the community to be taken down, and also held Google liable for failing to comply with her extrajudicial request before the lawsuit was filed, and ordered the company to pay damages to her.
 
(4) The community was then taken down, and Google filed an appeal that was rejected by the State Court of Appeals.
 
(5) Google filed another appeal, this time to the Supreme Court of Brazil, and the issue was considered important enough to be decided as a ""general repercussion"" matter, setting a binding precedent. The Supreme Court of Brazil will eventually decide, then, whether an online intermediary that hosts third party content should be held liable for failing to comply with a mere request from an user for content takedown, or if liability can only stem from failure to comply with a court order.
 
(6) Please note, however, that this case was filed before Marco Civil, according to which intermediaries can only be held liable for third party content if they fail to comply with a judicial decision ordering the removal of said content. Up until then, courts usually decided that failure to comply with the extrajudicial request of the plaintiff was already grounds to hold intermediaries liable.] /div>

LEGISLATION


Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Act 2015 (Cth)  
 
[Website blocking scheme: Section 115A of the Copyright Act 1968 enables copyright owners to the Federal Court of Australia for an injunction requiring ISPs to disable access to online services hosted outside Australia. Before granting the injunction, the Court must be satisfied that the foreign site either directly infringes copyright  or ‘facilitates’ infringement. Rightsholders bear the onus of showing that the ‘the primary purpose of the online location is to infringe, or to facilitate the infringement of, copyright (whether or not in Australia).’ The Court must take into consideration a range of factors including whether disabling access to the online location is a proportionate response in the circumstances, the impact on any person likely to be affected by the grant of the injunction, and whether it is in the public interest to disable access to the online location. Once granted, the injunction requires the ISP to take reasonable steps to disable access to the online location. The Court has further powers to make detailed orders in relation to the technical means to be adopted by the ISP to disable access. This provision came into force on 30 June 2015.]
 

Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 (Cth) Sch 9 & Copyright Legislation Amendment Act 2004 (Cth) Sch 1 (Safe Harbours)
 
[Safe harbours for intermediaries were introduced as part of the Australia - United States Free Trade Agreement (Ch 17) by the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 (Cth) Sch 9 and amended by the Copyright Legislation Amendment Act 2004 (Cth) Sch 1. The safe harbours largely follow the structure of 17 USC 512, although they have been substantially redrafted. The safe harbours limit the liability for intermediaries to injunctive relief for transmission, caching, hosting, and indexing activities (Section 116AG). The conditions imposed on intermediaries seeking to rely on the safe harbours include a reasonably implemented termination policy for repeat infringers and a notice and takedown regime (Section 116AH(1)). The equivalent of US vicarious liability, expressed as a “financial benefit that is directly attributable to the infringing activity if the carriage service provider has the right and ability to control the activity” is expressly excluded from the scope of the hosting and indexing safe harbours (Section 116AH(1)). Importantly, the safe harbours only apply to Internet Service Providers (defined as ‘Carriage Service Providers’ under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) s 87.)]
 


Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), Schedule 5, Cl 91(1)
 
[Clause 91(1) of Schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) provides a general limitation of liability for internet service providers and content hosts from Australian State and Territory laws for material hosted on behalf of another. On its face, Cl 91(1) appears to provide a strong immunity similar in effect to Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act. The Federal clause renders any State or Territory legislation and any rule of common law or equity invalid to the extent that it: subjects internet hosts or ISPs to criminal or civil liability for hosting or transmitting content where the host is not aware of the nature of the content; or requires an internet host or ISP to monitor, make inquiries about, or keep records of, content hosted or transmitted. In practice, Cl 91(1) has not been greatly tested, and its operation is still unclear. Clause 91(1) provides little additional protection from the common law tort of defamation, as amended by legislation of Australian States and Territories, which applies to anyone who ‘publishes’ a defamatory imputation. While there are defences for ‘innocent dissemination’ which will apply to internet intermediaries who are publishers, these defences evaporate once the intermediary is put on notice, at which point Cl 91(1) will no longer apply. Recently, the provision was successfully relied upon in Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125 (13 June 2012) to invalidate overly broad suppression orders which may have required intermediaries to prevent access to prejudicial material, wherever that material may be hosted globally.]
 

Copyright Regulations 1969 (Cth), Part 3A
 
[Setting out the particulars of the notice and takedown regime.]
 

Copyright Act 1968 (Cth)
 
[Sections 36(1) and 101(1) establish the exclusive right to ‘authorise’ the doing, in Australia, of any act comprised in the copyright. Whether an intermediary has ‘authorised’ an act of infringement is a question of fact assessed in all of the circumstances. ‘Authorise’ is defined as ‘sanction’, ‘approve’ or ‘countenance’ (UNSW v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26), and assessed with specific regard to: (a) the extent (if any) of the person’s power to prevent the doing of the act concerned; (b) the nature of any relationship existing between the person and the person who did the act concerned (c) whether the person took any reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the doing of the act, including whether the person complied with any relevant industry codes of practice. (Sections 36(1A), 101(1A)). ‘Mere conduit’ exceptions exists in Sections 39B and 112E, but the provisions have very little significance following iiNet. There are exceptions for temporary reproductions of works (Section 43A) or copies of other subject matter (Section 111A) made in the course of making or receiving a communication, but these does not apply if the communication itself is an infringement.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS


Copyright Notice Scheme – Industry Code (pending registration under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth)), April 2015
 
[An industry-negotiated graduated response Code was submitted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) for registration as an industry code under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) on 8 April 2015. The Code introduces a Copyright Notice Scheme that requires Internet Service Providers to pass on warnings to residential fixed account holders who are alleged to have infringed copyright. The scheme consists of an escalating series of infringements notices. These notices include educational material designed to deter copyright infringing behaviour and educate consumers about available and lawful content alternatives. Upon receipt of a third and final notice within a 12-month period, account holders may challenge the validity of the allegations by having them independently reviewed by a panel. The Code also provides for a ‘facilitated preliminary discovery’ court process. Where an account holder receives three notices within a 12-month period, a rightsholder can file an application for preliminary discovery in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit Court seeking access to the account holder’s details. ISPs must “act reasonably” to facilitate and assist in this application. The Court retains discretion as to whether preliminary discovery should be granted. The Code has not yet been registered by the ACMA since ISPs and rightsholders have not yet been able to reach commercial agreement about who will bear the costs of the scheme. Once the Scheme is registered, approximately 70 of Australia’s largest ISPs will be required to comply with it. ISPs who fail to comply will be liable to civil penalties. The effectiveness of the Code will be independently evaluated 18 months after its commencement.]
 

Online Copyright Infringement – Discussion Paper, July 2014 (Public consultation) [ENACTED as the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringment) Act 2015 (see above)]
 
[The Australian Government Attorney-General’s and Communications’ Departments released a discussion paper proposing to extend the scope of secondary infringement, introduce website blocking provisions, and broaden the safe harbours in Australia’s copyright legislation. The proposal first aims to overturn the Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd (below) decision by enlarging the test for authorisation liability of all secondary actors. The proposed amendments reduce the importance of control to secondary liability and instead focus on whether the defendant took “reasonable steps” to prevent infringing behaviour. The discussion paper also includes proposals to give rightsholders the ability to apply to the court for injunctive relief requiring ISPs to block access to overseas websites facilitating illicit downloading of copyright-protected content. Finally, the proposal would rectify the copyright safe harbours to cover all entities providing network services, rather than only “carriage service providers”. Submissions to this public consultation are available here. It is still unknown when the Government will respond to the consultation.]
 

Australia-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA), signed on April 8th 2014 (Chapter 13, Intellectual Property Rights, Article 13.5)
 
[Proposing an amendment of the Copyright Act 1968 in due course to provide a legal incentive for online service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in preventing infringement due to the High Court’s decision in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd (see below), which found that ISPs are not liable for authorising the infringements of subscribers.]


DECISIONS


Superior Courts




Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Piscioneri v Brisciani [2015] ACTSC 106, May 6, 2015
[defamation, hosting provider, forum operator, publisher]
 
[The proprietor of an online discussion forum was held liable in defamation for posts made by himself and third parties about the plaintiff. The self-represented defendant was found to be the ‘publisher’ of relevant posts on the basis that he had the ability to moderate and remove posts and actively participated in the discussion. ]
 

Supreme Court of New South Wales, Bleyer v. Google Inc. [2014] NSWSC 897, August 12, 2014
[defamation, search engine, Google, publisher]
 
[Bleyer brought a claim in defamation against Google on the basis of its organic search results. The New South Wales Supreme Court dismissed the claim on summary judgment on the basis that Google is not a publisher of its search results, at least prior to notification of a complaint. Google’s production of the search results involves no human input, apart from the creation of its search algorithm. The Court rejected the conclusion reached in Trkulja (below) and explicitly adopted the UK position on this point (Metropolitan International Schools Ltd v Designtechnica Corporation [2009] EWHC 1765; Tamiz v Google Inc [2012] EWHC 449).]
 

Supreme Court of New South Wales, Visscher v. Maritime Union of Australia (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 350, March 31, 2014
[defamation, webpage, hyperlink, publisher]
 
[New South Wales Supreme Court found the Maritime Union was liable for publishing defamatory imputations when it hyperlinked to a third party webpage. The Court held that the words “Read Full Story” showed the Maritime Union ‘published’ and accepted responsibility for the content of the hyperlinked webpage. The words conveyed to the reader that the Maritime Union considered the defamatory imputations in the hyperlinked article to be part of a complete version of events. Accordingly, the hyperlink amounted to a ‘publication’ of the defamatory imputations in the hyperlinked webpage. The Court stressed that the question of publication is always one of fact, not law; it was therefore inappropriate to decide that hyperlinking could never amount to publication.] 
 


High Court of Australia, Google Inc. v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2013) 249 CLR 435; [2013] HCA 1, February 6, 2013
[trade and commerce, misleading or deceptive conduct, advertising, search engine, Google, AdWords]
 
[The High Court of Australia held that Google did not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct under s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2, Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)) by displaying or publishing misleading AdWords in organic search results. Google was not the author of the sponsored links; the advertisers were the authors, as they determined every relevant aspect of the sponsored links. Google's automated response (of displaying the sponsored link) to a user's search request merely assembled the information to be displayed as an advertisement. In doing so, Google neither adopted nor endorsed the misleading representations made by the advertisers, and was merely passing on the sponsored links 'for what they were worth'. Google was not relevantly different to physical intermediaries who publish, display or broadcast others' advertisements. The Court held that it was clear that ordinary and reasonable users of Google's search engine would have understood that the sponsored links, and the representations of those links, were created by the advertisers, and not adopted or endorsed by Google.]
 

Supreme Court of Victoria, Trkulja v. Google Inc. & Anor [2012] VSC 533, November 12, 2012
[defamation, search engine, google, publisher]
 
[Plaintiff’s personal information and photos in Google’s search engine were displayed together with pictures of major known criminals in Melburne, Australia. Plaintiff sued Google for defamation and required the content to be taken down. Plaintiff claimed that the search results were defamatory because created the false innuendo that he was involved with crime in Melburne. The jury in this case was asked to answer the question whether search engines are liable for publishing defamatory materials that are assembled for the first time in an automated manner by their software. Jury found that search engines, such as Google, are publisher of the defamatory material when their software produce and put together search results in accordance with its intended operation. The judge in this case instructed the jury that it was entitled to consider Google as an intentional online publisher or internet newsagent for the automated results even before it had notice of the defamatory materials, because the intrinsic algorithmic design was to associate and display search results in such a manner.]
 

Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty. Ltd. v. Ibrahim (2012) 83 NSWLR 52; (2012) 293 ALR 384; (2012) 263 FLR 211; [2012] NSWCCA 125, June 13, 2012
[criminal trial, suppression order, inconsistency with federal law, constitutional validity of suppression order, media and communications]
 
[Successful appeal against suppression orders that would oblige internet content hosts to remove, or otherwise restrict access to, content they were not aware of. The suppression orders, made pursuant to state law, purported to prohibit the disclosure, dissemination or access to content via the internet, of material referring to a criminal trial. The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal found the orders to be inconsistent with the safe harbors in Clause 91 of Schedule 5 the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth).]
 

High Court of Australia, Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited [2012] HCA 16, April 20, 2012
[copyright, authorisation, ISPs, BitTorrent, indifference, countenance]
 
[The High Court of Australia held that iiNet, Australia’s second largest ISP, was not liable for authorising its customers’ infringement of copyright films downloaded over BitTorrent. The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft, now the Australian Screen Association, organised a lawsuit brought by 34 movie and television studios, alleging that iiNet was liable by failing to act upon notices alleging that users were infringing their copyrights. The court found that iiNet’s power to contractually terminate the internet accounts of infringing users was only an indirect power to prevent the primary infringements and insufficient to ground liability. Termination would also expose iiNet to the risk of wrongful termination, and would go further than simply preventing infringement by also denying iiNet customers the non-infringing uses of the internet connection. Therefore iiNet’s inactivity in the face of infringement notices from copyright holders was not indifference amounting to authorisation. The court was critical of the appellants’ reliance on “countenance” to expand the core notion of “authorise” and highlighted the dangers of relying on synonyms for “authorise” found in the dictionary. The court also noted that the mere conduit exception, s 112E, was enacted from an abundance of caution and has no practical effect.Because iiNet had not authorised its customers acts of infringement, the High Court was not required to examine the operation of the safe harbours. The appeal decision of the Full Federal Court below had held that iiNet was not eligible for the protection of the safe harbours as it had not reasonably implemented an appropriate repeat infringer policy. iiNet had argued that its unwritten policy was to terminate the accounts of subscribers who had admitted to infringement or had been found by a court or other authority to have infringed copyright, or when ordered to do so by a competent court. Each member of the Full Federal Court found that this was not an appropriate policy (Justice Emmett described the “so-called policy” as “no more than a policy to obey the law” [264]).]
 
High Court of Australia, University of New South Wales v. Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26; (1975) 133 CLR 1
[copyright, authorisation, sanction, approve, countenance, photocopies]
 
[The University of New South Wales was found liable for authorising the infringements of those who used the photocopiers it provided in its library. The case was brought as a test case, with plaintiffs alleging that UNSW was liable for making the photocopy machines available within its library without supervision and without appropriate notices about copyright rules. The High Court held that “authorise” in s 36(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 means “sanction, approve, countenance”. Two approaches to evaluating authorisation liability emerged from the case. Justice Gibbs stated the test which would later be codified in ss 36(1A) and 101(1A): “It seems to me... that a person who has under his control the means by which an infringement of copyright may be committed – such as a photocopying machine – and who makes it available to other persons, knowing, or having reason to suspect, that it is likely to be used for the purpose of committing an infringement, and omitting to take reasonable steps to limit its use to legitimate purposes, would authorize any infringement that resulted from its use.” Justice Jacobs, with whom McTiernan ACJ agreed, instead focused on the implied invitation given by UNSW to library users to make use of the photocopying machines as they saw fit. By making this invitation without any limitations, UNSW had implicitly authorised any infringements that might result.]
 

Lower Courts



Federal Court of Australia, Dallas Buyers Club LLC v iiNet Limited (No. 4) [2015] FCA 838, August 14, 2015
[copyright, ISPs, hosting provider, BitTorrent, preliminary discovery, infringement]
 
[In a subsequent decision following Dallas Buyers Club LLC v iiNet Limited (see below), the court rejected Voltage Pictures’ draft demands as unreasonable and excessive. The court was satisfied Voltage could ask for the costs of a single copy of the film and an appropriately proportioned fee to recover its legal costs so far. However, the court rejected attempts to multiply these fees, potentially thousands of times, for other BitTorrent peers to whom the subscriber may have transmitted parts of the film. The court also rejected the claim for monetary penalties based on infringements of other copyright owners’ rights that account holders may have admitted to. ]>
 

Federal Court of Australia, Dallas Buyers Club LLC v iiNet Limited [2015] FCA 317, 07 April 7, 2015
[copyright, ISPs, hosting provider, BitTorrent, preliminary discovery, infringement]
 
[The Federal Court of Australia ordered preliminary discovery from iiNet and five other Australian ISPs of the information of 4,726 account holders of IP addresses believed to have infringed copyright in the 2012 film Dallas Buyers Club. The Court was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for a preliminary discovery application. In making the order, the court imposed several conditions on the applicants. First, the information of the account holders could only be used for the purposes of recovering compensation for the infringements and should not otherwise be disclosed without the leave of the Federal Court. Second, a draft of any letter the applicants intend to send to account holders associated with the identified IP addresses must be submitted to the court.
 


Federal Court of Australia, Rana v. Google Australia Pty. Ltd. and Google Inc. [2013] FCA 60, February 7, 2013
[defamation, search engine, Google, control, publisher]
 
[Rana claimed damages from Google Australia and Google Inc. in defamation for publishing links to defamatory websites in its search results. The Federal Court granted summary judgment to Google Australia, holding that it had no control over the search results. Leave was granted to serve Google Inc. extraterritorially, although the court expressed doubt as to whether Google could be described as a “publisher” of the defamatory imputations.]
 
Federal Court of Australia, Clarke v. Nationwide News Pty. Ltd. (t/as The Sunday Times) (2012) 289 ALR 345; [2012] FCA 307, March 27, 2012
[defamation, racial discrimination, vilification, news article, website host, publisher, readership comments]
 
[A news website publisher was found liable for publishing vilifying comments posted by a reader. A claim was brought under s 18C the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), which prohibits doing or saying anything unlawful on the basis of race. The court held that the news website was responsible for reader comments because it actively sought comments from readers, and reserved the right to not publish or to modify the comments. This level of control, combined with actual knowledge, was sufficient to find the newspaper responsible. Damages of $12,000 were awarded against Nationwide News.]
 

District Court South of Australia, Duffy v Google Inc [2011] SADC 178, November 15, 2011
[defamation, search engine, linking, snippets, interlocutory]
 
[Duffy alleged defamation against Google Inc and Google Australia Pty Ltd for search results that contained links to third-party pages containing defamatory material and extracted snippets that were themselves defamatory. The claim against Google Australia was rejected on the basis that there was no evidence it had the ability to remove the URL links and snippets from the Google Search index. The interlocutory application against Google Inc was denied on the balance of convenience without coming to a determination as to whether Google Inc was a ‘publisher’ of allegedly defamatory imputations.]
 


Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187, December 18, 2006
[copyright, authorisation, filesharing, hyperlinks, liability for linking, control]
 
[Cooper and his hosting provider, Comcen, were liable for authorising infringements by users of his website, mp3s4free.net, which linked to infringing MP3 files on third-party websites. The index was populated by links submitted by users, but no infringing material was stored or communicated by Cooper or ComCen. The court found that Cooper had the power to prevent infringement because he could have not provided his website in the first place (Branson J) or could have not accepted or subsequently disabled and removed links to infringing content (Kenny J). Second, the relationship between Cooper and users was commercial, because Cooper benefitted financially from sponsorship and advertisements on the website which directly increased with the volume of infringing content. Finally, the court held that Cooper did not take any reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the infringements. The disclaimer on his website (“When you download a song, you take full responsibility for doing so. None of the files on this site are stored on our servers. We are just providing links to remote files.”) was merely cosmetic and had no real effect. Justice Kenny concluded that the website “was in substance an invitation to use the hyperlinks provided” and that Cooper. The court also held Cooper’s ISP, Comcen, liable for authorisation. The court found that Comcen was aware of the high level of usage of Cooper’s website and its problems with copyright. Comcen also benefited from infringements: Cooper received free web-hosting in exchange for displaying the Comcen logo on his website. Comcen had the power to prevent the infringements because it had the power to withdraw the hosting of Cooper’s website, but that it had not taken the “reasonable steps” of either withdrawing hosting or placing pressure on Cooper to stop his website being used predominantly for copyright infringement.]
 
Federal Court of Australia, Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242, September 5, 2005
[copyright, authorisation, peer-to-peer, filesharing, filters]
 
[Sharman, who operated the Kazaa filesharing platform, were found liable for authorising the infringements of its users. The court held that Sharman knew that the Kazaa system was primarily used to share copyright material. Infringing activity attracted more visitors to the Kazaa site, which benefitted Sharman through advertising revenue. Although there was no Kazaa central server through which Sharman could control users’ activities, the court held that Sharman had the power to prevent infringements because it could have forced an upgrade of the software to inhibit infringement. The court considered, for example, that a keyword filter could have been implemented, or Sharman could have flooded users’ search results with files containing only copyright infringement warnings. Since Sharman had the power to take these steps but did not, the court found Sharman liable for authorising infringement.]

Revising the Scope of the Copyright Safe Harbour Scheme (public consultation)
 
[The Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department released a public consultation paper in October 2011 concerning the scope of the copyright safe harbour provisions. Submissions were accepted until 22 November 2011 and are available at the link above. As at 11 January 2014, the Australian Government has not issued a formal response and consideration of the scope of the safe harbour scheme is ongoing. In particular, the Australian Government is considering whether the safe harbours should be expanded to cover intermediaries other than Internet Service Providers.]

LEGISLATION


Decreto-Lei n.º 7-2004, de 7 de Janeiro [Decree-Law No. 7/2004 of 7 January], Lei do Comércio Electrónico, January 7, 2004 [English Version]
 
[(1) Transposes into national law Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic commerce). In general, the decree presents a scope similar to the Directive. When examined in more detail though, one can observe that the decree, in certain aspects, went beyond the Directive, regulating a number of legal issues that were not explicitly covered by the Portuguese legal system and neither by the Directive. 
 
(2) The provisions of the Decree-Law that address the liability of service providers can be found in Chapter III (Articles 11 – 19), entitled ""Liability of networking service providers.""
 
(i) The statute implements the liability regime estiblesed by the eCommerce directive for the activities of “mere conduit” (Article 14), “caching” or intermediary storage (Article 15) and “hosting” or main storage (Article 16).
 
(ii) Article 17 regulates the intermediary liability of service providers for content aggregation. This notion refers to hyperlinking and search engines as these are deemed to aggregate “content” by referencing third-party content. Portugal is thus one of the few Member States which introduced specific norms dealing with liability for hyperlinking and liability of search engines. Content aggregator service providers, which allow access to illegal contents by hyperlinking or search engines, are subject to the same liability regime of hosting service providers.
 
(iii) Article 18, No.1, establishes that in cases of linking and hosting (Articles 16 and 17), the service provider is not bound to remove the disputed contents or to disable access to the information on the grounds of a claim made by an interested party, where the illegality is not obvious (i.e., in cases in which the information or activity is not manifestly illegal). Additionally, Article18 regulate the procedure of out-of-court preliminary dispute settlement regarding cases, whose illegality is not obvious. According to such procedure, any interested party may appeal to the relevant supervisory entity (the authority is designed according to its competences; ANACOM – Communications National Authority – is the competent authority by default). Moreover, whoever has a legal interest in maintaining that content online is likewise entitled to appeal to the supervisory entity against a decision of the provider to remove or disable access to that content. The recourse to these procedures does not prejudice the capacity of any interested parties to obtain judicial redress through an action brought before a civil or criminal court.
 
(iv) Article 19 – entitled “Relationship with the right to information” – establishes that content aggregation shall not trigger liability on the sole ground that there are illegal contents in the linked website, despite the awareness of this fact by the provider. The provision further elaborates on this point by stating that the link is legal if performed with objectivity, and represents a way of exercising the right to information. On the contrary, the link shall be deemed illegal if it is a way of adopting the illegal content being linked to as one’s own. The assessment of the legality of linking is made by considering the circumstances of the case, namely:
the possible confusion of contents of the linking and linked websites;
the automatic or intentional character of the link;
the area of linked website to which the link is made.]

[This law covers the legal protection of intellectual creations in the literary sphere and artistic works. It transposed into Portuguese legislation EU Directive n.º 2004/28/EC of 29 April 2004.] [For a detailed overview of the Copyright legal framework in Portugal see the chapter on Portugal by D.

DECISIONS
[There are currently no known cases that have been brought before the courts on the issue of intermediary liability.]


Administrative Procedures


[As mentioned above, Portugal has specific intermediary  liability provisions (Article 17, Decree-Law No. 7/2004) for service providers associated with content by means of search engines, hyperlinks or similar procedures (e.g., directories). As a general rule, the intermediary is subject to the same liability rules as host providers. Two Portuguese administrative resolutions (provisional settlement of disputes) have been issued against host providers and intermediary service providers associated with content by means of search engines. These two cases were settled through (administrative) injunctions based on Article 18(2) of the Portuguese e-commerce law (see above).]
 
Administrative decision from the National Authority of Communications (ANACOM), Nokia Portugal v. Verza Facility Management, Google and others, May 18, 2004
 
[This administrative resolution ordered a host provider to remove the incriminated website from the network. The decision also required all network content aggregation providers (permitting a direct or indirect access to the incriminated website, and thus associated with illicit content) to disable access to the website. This ruling seems to cover, at least indirectly, hyperlink providers. This resolution, which is very brief, does not offer further details.]
 
Administrative decision from General Inspection of Cultural Activities, 2005
 
[This administrative resolution also imposed on host providers and service providers associated with content an obligation to block access to a website that infringed copyright. This resolution, which is not available, does not offer further details.]

[(1) implementing the InfoSoc Directive (2001/29) mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction which are transient or incidental, have no independent economic significance, and are an integral and essential part of a technological process whose sole purpose is to enable (a) a transmission in a network among third parties by an intermediary, or (b) a lawful use (art. 31.1);  (2) providing that copyright owners may ask for injunctions, where appropriate, against an intermediary whose services are resorted to by a third party to infringe copyright, even where the intermediary’s activity is not infringing in itself (arts. 138, 139.1.h, 141.6);  (3) creating an administrative body -- the Second Section of the Copyright Commission (CPI) -- which orders injunctions against information society services who infringe on copyright, particularly websites providing links to infringing works in a purposeful and massive way; it may require payment, advertising, and access service providers to stop providing their services to the infringer; (4) creating a compulsory levy on news aggregators (art. 32); (5) establishing inducement, contributory and vicarious liability for copyright infringements (art. 138).] [See also CIS Blog]

[establishing the particular rules governing the functions of the Copyright Commission, the Second Section of which has the power to issue injunctions against information society service providers that infringe copyrights; in practice, this Section decides on claims for injunctions against websites providing links to infringing contents located in P2P networks or somewhere else in the Internet].

[(1) proposing the enhancement of copyright enforcement mechanisms; (2) proposing an overhaul of the administrative procedure, established in art. 158 of the Copyright Act, against internet service providers (ISPs) who infringe copyrights, granting more powers to the Second Section of the Copyright Commission so it can require payment, advertising, and access service providers to stop providing their services to the ISP when it doesn’t voluntarily comply with the injunction issued; the Section could impose administrative fines to an ISP who repeatedly disobeys an injunction; (3) proposing that the administrative procedure targets at particular websites that provide links to apparently infringing works in a purposeful and massive way, even when the links have been submitted by the websites' users; In contrast, those who carry out mere technical intermediary activities would not be targeted; (4) proposing a levy on news aggregators, (5) proposing an amendment to introduce inducement, contributory and vicarious liability in the Copyright Act, (6) proposing that ISP could be obliged in some situations to reveal the identity of a subscriber who allegedly engages in copyright infringement.]

Superior Courts
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, Palomo v. Google, 144/2013, March 4, 2013
[defamation, liability, actual knowledge, linking exemption, search engine]
 
[holding Google and its CEO are not liable for the search engine’s links to pieces of news containing false accusations against an individual; defendants are shielded from liability by Art. 17 of the Spanish Information Society Services Act, which sets forth a safe harbor for information location tools; notices sent by the aggrieved person were not enough to trigger actual knowledge because the illegal character of the information was not obvious by itself and thus Google did not need to take the links down to benefit from the linking safe harbor].
 
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, eleconomista.com, 128/2013, February 26, 2013
[defamation, liability, hosting exemption]
 
[holding a company running a digital newspaper liable for defamatory comments posted on its website by its users; the defendant should have taken more precautions and exert more control on the users’ comments; the defendant chose not to receive a notification which was not clearly addressed to site; in doing so it prevented the aggrieved person to inform the site about the defamation; the obvious defamatory nature of the comments is enough to trigger actual knowledge].
 
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, merodeando.com, 742/2012, December 4, 2012
[defamation, liability, hosting exemption, linking exemption, freedom of expression]
 
[holding a blogger not liable for one of his posts and for the comments posted by users; the court found that both the blogger’s post – which linked to allegedly defamatory contents – and the comments posted by users did not amount to a defamation; while they contained harsh criticism against the claimant – the Spanish copyright collecting society, SGAE – they were protected by the right of freedom of expression; thus although the blogger had actual knowledge of the contents and chose not to remove them, no liability attaches because the contents were ultimately licit; the ruling reversed a previous judgment issued by a lower court holding the blogger liable]. 
 
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, megakini.com, 172/2012, April 3, 2012
[copyright, fair use, three step test, caching exemption, linking exemption] 
 
[dismissing a copyright infringement claim brought by a website owner against Google; the Court of Appeals held that while Google’s acts of reproducing and making available a cached copy of the website were not covered by the caching or the linking safe harbor, nor by the temporary reproductions exemption, some general limits apply to copyright owners’ claims, such as the doctrines of abuse of right and the ius usus innocui — the right of using someone else’s property in a way that does not harm its owner; the applicability of those limits to copyright can be inferred from art. 40 of the Spanish Copyright Act, which enacts the “three step test”; the Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeals’ ruling, deeming the plaintiff’s claim an abuse of his right].
 
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, alasbarricadas.com, 72/2011, February 10, 2011
[defamation, liability, internet forum, hosting exemption]
 
[holding the owner of an internet forum liable for defamatory remarks posted by users against the Spanish pop singer Ramoncín; the court considered that the owner of the forum did not qualify for the hosting exemption because (a) the defamatory nature of the contents was self-evident and thus the defendant should be deemed aware of facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity, and (b) the website owner was negligent as it did not provide enough contact details to be notified about illegal content].
 
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, quejasonline.com, 316/2010, May 18, 2010
[defamation, liability, internet forum, hosting exemption]
 
[holding the owner of an internet forum not liable for its users’ defamatory messages; the website owner complied with the hosting exemption’s requirements to be free from liability as it had no actual knowledge or awareness of facts or circumstances revealing the illegal nature of the offensive comment, and promptly removed it once notified about it].
 
Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, Asociación de Internautas v. SGAE, 773/2009, December 9, 2009
[defamation, liability, gripe site, actual knowledge, hosting exemption]
 
[holding the defendant liable for hosting a third party gripe site and awarding 36,000 Euros in damages to plaintiffs; the defendant could not benefit from the hosting exemption as it was deemed to know about the defamatory contents of the gripe site; the defendant argued that, according to the language of the hosting exemption as transposed into Spanish law (art. 16 LSSICE), actual knowledge only exists when there has been a prior decision declaring the illegal nature of the third party contents; the court held instead that Art. 16 LSSICE must be construed openly, as otherwise it would unreasonably limit the possibilities of obtaining actual knowledge of the illegal content hosted and thus would not be in accordance with the eCommerce Directive]. 
 
Appellate Courts
Audiencia Provincial [Court of Appeals] of Castellón, Section 1, Criminal, Bajatetodo.com  [ . . . ], November 25, 2014
[copyright, criminal liability, linking, webmaster]
 
[(1) The Criminal Court of Appeal of Castellón upheld a previous decision charging the webmaster of the website Bajatetodo.com with a eighteen-month prison term under Article 270 of the Spanish Criminal Code. The website used to provide links to a miscellaneous array of infringing materials available online.
 
(2) The Court of Appeal applied the language of the new copyright reform (see above) by stressing that the webmaster went well beyond a mere passive neutral intermediary role by selecting, ordering and indexing the online resources to access the infringing materials. For this reason, the webmaster could not benefit of the linking safe harbour, specifically provided by the Spanish implementation of the eCommerce Directive.
 
(3) Additionally, the Court of Appeal of Castellón made specific reference to the Svensson case decided by the European Court of Justice. The Court rejected the earlier assumption by Spanish courts that operators of websites linking to infringing contents online cannot be held criminally liable because they do not engage in acts of communication to the public. According to Svensson, the Spanish Court argued, linking to infringing contents constitutes unauthorized communication to the public, and therefore copyright infringment, which triggers the website operators' criminal liability.] [See also CIS blog]
 
Audiencia Provincial [Court of Appeals] of Madrid, Section 28 (specializing on IP), Civil, Telecinco v. YouTube, 11/2014, January 14, 2014
[copyright, YouTube, hosting exemption] 
 
[holding YouTube not liable for copyright infringement; the plaintiff had not properly identified the allegedly infringing videos; YouTube met the conditions required by the hosting safe harbor and thus was exempted from liability; YouTube cannot be enjoined generally to prevent copyright infringing uploads]. [see also CIS blog] 
 
Audiencia Provincial [Court of Appeals] of Barcelona, Section 15 (specializing on IP), Civil, Promusicae v. R Cable y Telecomunicaciones Galicia, 470/2013, December 18, 2013

Audiencia Provincial [Court of Appeals] of Barcelona, Section 15 (specializing on IP), Civil, Indice-web.com, 301/11, July 7, 2011
[copyright, communication to the public, linking]
 
finding that a website offering links to copyright infringing content located somewhere else on the Internet does not satisfy either acts of reproduction or acts of communication to the public element].

Law No. 5651, May 23, 2007, Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Suppression of Crimes Committed by means of Such Publications
 
[(1) The Law No. 5651 aims to combat certain online crimes and regulates procedures regarding such crimes committed on the Internet through content, hosting, and access providers.  It also defines the administrative regulations and powers of the Presidency of Telecommunications and Communication (TIB), which has been empowerd to issue blocking orders. (2) The Law regulates the liability of Internet intermediaries, including Content, Access, Hosting service providers and “Mass use” providers, i.e. “Internet cafes,” in Articles 4,5,6 and 7 for the first time in Turkey. On 24 October, 2007 the government published the Regulations governing the access and hosting providers which includes the principles and procedures for assigning activity certificates to those providers. An amended version of these Regulations was published on March 1, 2008. Regulations governing the mass use providers, the so called Internet cafes, was published on November 1, 2007. On 30 November, 2007, the government published the Regulations Governing the Publications on the Internet, which included detailed principles and procedural matters regarding to the application of Law No. 5651. In February 2011, BTK released a decision titled the “Safer Internet”, requiring service providers to offer to their customers the option to use one of four packages: Family, Children, Standard and Domestic package. Safer Internet Service can be activated, de-activated or profiles can be changed by applying to any of the online operating centers, Short Message Service (SMS), call center or Internet service providers. (3) Although the Law was enacted to protect children from pornographic content in the Internet, as a consequence of the website blocking powers given to TIB Presidency ex officio by Article 8, the number of blocked websites in Turkey hit a figure around 40.000 in 2014. (4) In February 2014, the Law has been amended with more strict rules by the Government hrough two omnibus bills (see above).]

[Google, YouTube TIB, blocking order, constitutionality, freedom of expression]
 
[The Turkish Constitutional Court decided that TIB's blocking of the video sharing platform YouTube was unlawful and should have been be lifted as it violated Article 26 of the Turkish Constitution (freedom of expression) and individual rights. The decision followed a petition promoted by a number of legal scholars, Youtube, and civil rights activists. Akdeniz and Altıparmak drafted the petition stressing that the YouTube access ban not only obstructed freedom of expression, but also curtailed people's right to obtain information.].

[Coskun Ak was a forum moderator operated by Superonline, a well known ISP in Turkey. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison due to a particular message about human rights abuses in Turkey that was sent to the forum by an anonymous poster. The public prosecutor claimed that Mr. Ak’s position was similar to the editor of a newspaper. The court decided to sentence Ak for insulting and weakening the Republic of Turkey, the Military Forces, the Security Forces, and the Ministry of Justice, to one year in prison for each insult separately, totalling four years.

[copyright, freedom of expression, hosting provider, blocking order]
 
[(1) Last.fm was blocked by Turkish courts at the request of a local group representing rights holders. It was challenged by the applicant simply as a user of the site, without involvement by last.fm or local ISPs. He was denied standing by Turkish courts. (2) The Second Section ECHR found that the applicant could not claim to be a victim of an Article 10 violation. Two main arguments were put forward to sustain the inadmissibility decision: (a) the content was available to the applicant through other means and was not ‘of special interest’ to the applicant (cf. Khurshid Mustafa case where Iraqi family was prevented by landlord from installing a satellite dish to receive Arabic channels not available otherwise) (para. 25); (b) the case did not raise an important question of general interest – i.e. it was not political but commercial speech in whose regulation states enjoy a greater margin of appreciation (para. 28).]

 

Lower Courts

1st Criminal Court of Peace of Istanbul, Mehmet Selim Kiraz Case, No. 2015/1644, April 6, 2015
[dangerous speech, hosting provider, YouTube, Google, Twitter, blocking order]

 
[(1) The 1st Criminal Court of Peace in Istanbul issued a content removal and blocking order against Twitter, Facebook and YouTube according to a request of the Chief Public Prosecutor of the Terror and Organized Crime Investigation Bureau. The Prosecutor Office demanded that the images of the public prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held hostage at gunpoint will not be used anywhere on electronic platforms. Mr. Mehmet Selim Kiraz later died of the injuries he suffered during an attempt of the Turkish special forces to rescue him from the kidnappers. Possibly, 166 website were affected by the court order, including international newspaper websites such as The Independent, The Mirror, and Tgcom24 and major Turkish news channels and newspapers.
 
(2) The decision demanded the removal of the content and ordered the website blocking if the online platforms did not comply with the request. After the initial refusal to remove the content, the leading Turkish Internet Service providers implemented the ban on Twitter and YouTube. Facebook complied immediately with the request of removal and was not reached by the implementation of the blocking order. Facebook will appeal the decision, despite momentarily complying with the court order.
 
(3) Later, the blocking order on YouTube and Twitter was lifted after the companies complied with the court's request and removed from their platforms the links listed in the court order. ] [See also CIS blog.]

Criminal Court of First Instance of Ankara, Gölbaşı, Google Inc, YouTube, No. 2014/91 D, April 9, 2014
[YouTube, Google, TIB, blocking order]
​
[The Court finally ruled to unblock access to the popular video-sharing website YouTube, after initially ordering a temporary measure to reinstate the ban as per the prosecution’s request. (1) Access to YouTube was initially blocked on March 27, 2014 by an order of the Presidency of Telecommunications and Communication (TİB), a few hours after recordings of a key security meeting on Syria leaked online. TIB's ban was unilaterally ordered by TIB without being supported by a judicial decision. (2) Initially, a local court in the Ankara’s Gölbaşı district justified the ban on the grounds of a law incriminating insults to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. (3) On April 4, the Gölbaşı Court of Peace ordered that access to the website be unblocked, following an appeal from the Union of the Turkish Bar Associations. The court went on to say that the ban was too broad and in violation of freedom of speech. The Court recommended simply blocking 15 videos as oppose to the entire site. 4) The Gölbaşı Prosecutor’s Office objected to the ruling, arguing that the ban should remain in place because the 15 videos remain on the website and URL-specific blocking is not technically possible. (5) In response to the Prosecutor's objection, the Gölbaşı Criminal Court of First Instance, which is a higher court, reversed the earlier decision of April 5 by ruling that the ban will continue until the “criminal content” is removed by YouTube. (6) Finally, in response to an appeal filed by YouTube, the court revoked the preventive measure temporarily imposed and ruled previous verdicts that justified the ban on YouTube to “be declared null and void."" (7) According to this decision, TİB should unblock YouTube after it is officially notified of the ruling, even if YouTube does not remove the aforementioned videos. In fact, TİB decided not to enforce the court’s ruling to unblock Twitter and opted to wait for a Constitutional Court ruling to revoke the ban (see above).]

[Following a decision of the 5th Criminal Court of Peace of Istanbul Anadolu, TIB banned two Twitter accounts, discussing the government related corruption news that appeared in the mainstream and social media in Turkey in March 2014. The claimants, a Minister and one of his sons, requested the Court to ban access to the posts published through the Twitter account ""Hirsiza oy yok"", ""@oyyokhirsiza"" (""@No vote for thief), which allegedly published content that constituted an explicit violation of the claimants' personal rights. Twitter objected to this decision, since the content published fall under the scope of media freedom of speech.The 18th Criminal Court of Peace accepted Twitter's arguments and cancelled the previous decision, since it was in contrast with the Turkish Constitution. The 18th Criminal Court also noted that the claim alleging violation of personal rights could not be received, because ""the claimants are a former Minister [ . . . ] and his son. They are political figures, whose duties require public transparency and to be subject to public control."" ]

Criminal Court of Peace, Recep Konuk Corruption Case, 2010
[defamation, liability, search engines]
 
[A 2010 decision of the Turkish criminal court of peace provides an important precedent in regards to how Turkish courts should interpret and apply the provisions of Law No. 5651 to search term suggestions. The court held that Google cannot be held responsible for search-term suggestions appearing on its search engine when the search term “recep konuk corruption” and “recep konuk’s corruptions” appear. The court reasoned that what is being requested for removal is the search term suggestions and not content as understood by Law No. 5651. The court premised its reasoning as follows: “The removal of content which is reached through these search results can be requested from the content provider in accordance with the Law No. 5651 { . . . ]. [T]he obligations of the access providers are within the context of Article 6 and the request should be made to the access provider.” The court grants that search term suggestions are not to be considered content as understood under Law No. 5651.]

LEGISLATION


Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights
 
[Article 11 states that ""Member States shall also ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right, without prejudice to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29/EC.""]
 
Directive 2001/29/EC on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society
 
[Article 8(3) provides that “Member States shall ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.” ]
 
Directive 2000/31/EC on Certain Legal Aspects of Information Society Services, in particular Electronic Commerce, in the Internal Market 
 
[(1) Articles from 12 to 15 provides mere conduit, caching, and hosting exemptions for intermediaries, together with the exclusion of a general obligation on access, hosting and caching providers, to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor a general obligation actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.
 
(2) In particular, Article 14(1) provides that Member States shall ensure that hosting providers are not liable for the information stored at the request of the recipient, on condition that: (a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent; or (b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.
 
(3) Article 14(3) also states that the liability exemption for hosting providers provided in Article 14(1) ""shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement, nor does it affect the possibility for Member States of establishing procedures governing the removal or disabling of access to information.]

BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS

European Commission, Proposal for a Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, COM(2016) 593 final, September 14, 2016
 
[The draft directive aims—inter alia—to close the so called “value gap” between Internet platforms and copyright holders.  To that end, the proposed reform includes a provision that would impact platform operations. It requires intermediaries “that store and provide access to large amounts of works [. . .] uploaded by their users” to take appropriate and proportionate “measures to ensure the functioning of agreements concluded with rightholders for the use of their works” or “to prevent the availability on their services of [such] works,” including through “the use of effective content identification technologies.”]

European Commission, Communication, Online Platforms and the Digital Single Market: Opportunities and Challenges for Europe, COM(2016) 288 Final, May 25, 2016
 
[The Communication apparently endorses the plan of maintaining the existing intermediary liability regime.  However, the Commission stresses that “a number of specific issues relating to illegal and harmful content and activities online have been identified that need to be addressed.” In this regard, the Commission would launch a “sectorial legislation […] and problem-driven approach.”  Apparently, this sectorial action will target copyright-protected content, minors’ protection from harmful content, and incitement through hatred.  This should happen through a mix of legislative interventions—by updating the audiovisual and copyright regulations—and promotion of voluntary self-regulatory actions.  The Communication puts forward the idea that “the responsibility of online platforms is a key and cross-cutting issue.”]
 
European Commission, Communication, Towards a Modern, more European Copyright Framework, COM(2015) 626 final, December 9, 2015
 
[The Commission anticipated that policy and legislative action would be taken in respect of: (1) exceptions and limitations; (2) exclusive rights, including both clarifying issues facing linking and considering whether any action specific to news aggregators is needed; and (3) enforcement, including Follow the Money strategies, commercial-scale infringements, application of provisional and precautionary measures, and injunctions and their cross-border effect. In connection with this Communication and the Digital Single Market Strategy (below), the Commission launched a Public Consultation on the Regulatory Environment for Platforms, Online Intermediaries, Data and Cloud Computing and the Collaborative Economy and will issue a report shortly.]
 
European Commission, Communication, A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe, COM(2015) 192 final, May 6, 2015
 
[The Strategy plans the introduction of enhanced obligations that websites and other Internet intermediaries should have for dealing with unlawful third-party content and discusses what regulations should apply to a subset of those intermediaries deemed “internet platforms.” The Commission would like to discuss whether ""whether to require intermediaries to exercise greater responsibility and due diligence in the way they manage their networks and systems – a duty of care.""  (emphasis added). The Commission refers to enhanced responsibilities for dealing with illegal content, such as child pornography, terrorist materials, and content that infringes upon intellectual property rights. (See § 3.3)]
 
European Commission, Staff Working Document, E-commerce Action Plan 2012-2015. State of Play 2013,  SWD(2013) 153 final, April 23, 2013
 
[The Commission specifically prioritizes tackling excessive fragmentation of notice-and-take-down (or ""notice-and-action"") procedures in European jurisdictions (3.4, main action 12). This fragmentation in turn leads to a high level of legal uncertainty that makes Europe an uneasy business environment for intermediaries.]

DECISIONS


European Court of Justice, Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner, C-362/14, October 6, 2015
[Ireland, privacy, safe harbor, hosting provider, access provider, Facebook]
 
[(1) Maximillian Schrems, an Austrian citizen and Facebook user, lodged a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner saying that in light of Edward Snowden's revelations concerning the activities of the United States intelligence services, the law and practice of the United States did not offer adequate protection against surveillance by public authorities of the data transferred to that country. In this case, data provided to Facebook’s Irish subsidiary is transferred to servers located in the United States.
 
(2) The Court found that European data was not sufficiently protected in the United States and invalidated the Commission Decision 2000/520/EC that created the transatlantic U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement. The EU-US Safe Harbor agreement had been in place for 15 years and enabled U.S. companies to transfer data from Europe to the United States merely by self-certifying that they would comply with EU data protection standards. The Court held that even if the U.S. companies involved were taking adequate protection measures, U.S. public authorities are not subject to the Safe Harbor guidelines and therefore European citizens’ data and privacy was at risk to U.S. government surveillance.] [see also Global FoE]
 
European Court of Justice, C More Entertainment AB v Linus Sandberg, C‑279/13, March 26, 2015
[Sweden, copyright, broadcasting right, hosting providers, linking, live streaming, sport event]
 
[(1) The ECJ had to decide whether linking to live internet streams of sport events infringed on the exclusive related rights of broadcasting organizations. Prior to this case, the Court decided linking related issues in Svensson and Bestwater (see below). The request for a preliminary ruling came from the Supreme Court of Sweden. The online broadcaster C More Entertainment challenged the legality of Mr. Sandberg’s website hosting links enabling users to circumvent a paywall to watch its live streams of hockey matches. The ECJ concluded that national legislation may extend the exclusive right of the broadcasting organisations to acts of communication to the public encompassing broadcasts of sporting fixtures made live on internet.
 
(2) The referring court decided to drop a number of questions concerning whether placing clickable links on a website may be classified as an act of communication to the public. The ECJ already answered those questions in Svensson, noting that links communicate works to the public, but they are not infringing unless they make the work available to a new public. Therefore, links to authorized works freely available online do not infringe the right of communication to the public. In contrast, a link enabling users to circumvent a paywall would communicate the work to a new public and would be infringing.
 
(3) In this case, however, C More Entertainment does not own a copyright in the underlying sport event, which, as discussed here, does not reach the level of originality required for copyright protection. Instead, C More Entertainment enjoys a related right in the broadcasting of the sport event. According to Article 3(2)(d) of Directive 2001/29, Member States must provide broadcasting organisations with  “the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available” of fixations of their broadcasts to the public, “in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.” According to the ECJ, this ""right of making available to the public"" forms part of the wider ""right of communication to the public,"" which Article 3(1) grants to authors. The ECJ confirmed that “making available to the public” is intended to refer to ‘interactive on-demand transmissions’ characterized by the fact that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. As the ECJ noted, “that is not the case of transmissions broadcast live on internet.” C More Entertainment’s live streams of hockey matches would fall out of the scope of the rights granted by EU law to broadcasting organizations.
 
(4) Against this factual and legal background, the Swedish Supreme Court maintained only one question for the ECJ: May the Member States give wider protection to the exclusive right of authors by enabling “communication to the public” to cover a greater range of acts than provided for in Article 3(2) of [Directive 2001/29]? In practice, should Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29 be interpreted as precluding national legislation from extending the exclusive right of the broadcasting organisations to acts of communication to the public encompassing broadcasts of sporting fixtures made live on internet? Does EU law preclude Member States to extend the exclusive rights of the broadcasters to those acts which could be classified as ""acts of communication to the public"" but which do not constitute ""acts of making available to the public the fixations of their broadcasts in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them""?
 
(5) The ECJ answered to this question in the negative and held that “Directive 2006/115 [on Rental Right and Lending Right and on Certain Rights related to Copyright in the Field of Intellectual Property] gives the Member States the option of providing for more protective provisions with regard to the broadcasting and communication to the public of transmissions made by broadcasting organisations than those which must be instituted in accordance with Article 8(3) of that directive.” Therefore, the ECJ concluded, Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation from extending the exclusive broadcasting organisations' right of making available to the public referred to in Article 3(2)(d) to acts of communication to the public including live internet streams of sport events.] [See also CIS blog]
 
European Court of Justice, BestWater International GmbH v Michael Mebes and Stefan Potsch, C348/13, October 21, 2014
[Germany, copyright, infrigement, hosting providers, videos, framing, embedding]
 
[(1) The Court issued a reasoned order ex Article 99 of the Rule of Procedure of the European Court of Justice, which  applied the findings of the Svensson decision (see below).
 
(2) The case concerned the lawfullness under EU law of the practice of inserting on websites clickable links that use the technique of ""framing"" and through which the user was directed to a film on which BestWater maintained the exclusive rights. BestWater manufactures and markets water filter systems. For advertising needs, she produced a short film on the water pollution. The film was available on the video platform ""YouTube"" without Bestwater's consent. Mebes and Potsch are independent sales agents who act on behalf of a competitor of BestWater International. They each have a website where they promote the products marketed by their client. During the summer of 2010, Mebes and Potsch allowed the visitors to their websites to view BestWater's film through a web link using the technique of ""framing,"" giving the impression that it was shown on thier websites.
 
(3) The mere fact that a copyrighted work, freely available on a web site, is inserted on another website through a link using the technique of ""framing"" can not be described as ""communication to the public"" under EU law, to the extent that the work in question is not transmitted to a new public or disclosed following a specific technical mode, different from the original communication.]
 
European Court of Justice, Sotiris Papasavvas v O Fileleftheros Dimosia Etaireia Ltd and Others, C-291/13, September 11, 2014
[Greece, intermediaries, notion, limitation of civil liability]
 
[The ECJ clarified the notion of  ""information society services"" within the meaning of the Directive 2000/31/EC and the application of rules of civil liability for defamation to those intermediaries. The case involved an action brought by an individual for defamation against a daily national newspaper, which published the defamatory articles online. The ECJ concluded that 
 
(1) Directive 2000/31/EC must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of ‘information society services’ covers the provision of online information services for which the service provider is remunerated, not by the recipient, but by income generated by advertisements posted on a website;
 
(2) Directive 2000/31/EC does not preclude the application of rules of civil liability for defamation. In particular, the limitations of civil liability specified in Articles 12 to 14 of Directive 2000/31 
 
(a) do not apply to the case of a online version of a newspaper published by a company which is remunerated by income generated by commercial advertisements posted on that website, since that company has knowledge of the information posted and exercises control over that information, whether or not access to that website is free of charge; and
 
(b) are capable of applying in the context of proceedings between individuals relating to civil liability for defamation and information society service providers cannot oppose the bringing of legal proceedings for civil liability against them and, consequently, the adoption of a prohibitory injunction by a national court; 
 
(c) however, the limitations of liability provided for in those articles may be invoked by the provider in accordance with the provisions of national law transposing them or, failing that, for the purpose of an interpretation of that law in conformity with the directive. By contrast, Directive 2000/31 cannot, in itself, create obligations on the part of individuals and therefore cannot be relied on against those individuals.]
 
European Court of Justice, Technische Universität Darmstadt v Eugen Ulmer KG, C 117/13, September 11, 2014
[Germany, copyright, digitital libraries, digitization, reproduction, exception, limitations]
 
[The ECJ stated that European libraries may digitize books in their collection without permission from the rightholders. The decision confirmed a previous opinion of the ECJ's Advocate General.
 
(1) The ECJ noted that European law ""must be interpreted to mean that it does not preclude Member States from granting to publicly accessible libraries [. . . ] the right to digitise the works contained in their collections . . . ."" However, several caveats attach to this general statement. First, such act of reproduction must be necessary for the purpose of making those works available to users, by means of dedicated terminals, in public libraries, for the purpose of research or private study. (par. 46). Second, the ECJ recognizes this right provided that ""specific acts of reproduction"" are involved. Therefore, the public library may not digitize their entire collections. (par. 44-45). Third, ""the number of copies of each work made available to users by dedicated terminals [cannot be] greater than that which those libraries have acquired in analogue format."" (par. 48). Finally, ""although [ . . . ] the digitisation of the work is not, as such, coupled with an obligation to provide compensation, the subsequent making available of that work in digital format, on dedicated terminals, gives rise to a duty to make payment of adequate remuneration."" (par. 48).
 
(2) Also, as the ECJ clarified, this right does not extend to acts such as the printing out of works on paper or their storage on a USB stick, carried out by users from dedicated terminals. However, such acts may be authorised under national legislation transposing the exceptions or limitations included in Article 5(2)(a) or (b) of the Directive 2001/29/EC.] [See also CIS blog post].
 
European Court of Justice, Google Spain SL and Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD) and Mario Costeja González, C-131/12, May 13, 2014
[privacy, personal data, search engine, google, right to be forgotten, takedown]
 
[(1) ruling that ""an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties.” Thus, under certain circumstances, search engines can be asked to remove links to webpages containing personal data. (see also CIS bolg post)
 
(2) On November 26, 2014, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party issued the Guidelines on the Implementation of the CJEU Judgment on Google Spain v. Costeja, 14/EN WP 225, which are summarized in this CIS blog post.] 
 
European Court of Justice, UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH v Constantin Film Verleih GmbH and Wega Filmproducktionsgesellschaft mbH, Case C-314/12, March 27, 2014
[copyright, infringment, access providers, blocking orders, legitimacy]
 
[The ECJ stated that EU law must be interpreted as not precluding a court injunction that does not specify the measures which an access provider must take to block access to a website making available copyrighted material without the rightsholders’ permission. Additionally, the ECJ concludes that blocking orders can be imposed on access providers when they can avoid incurring coercive penalties for breach of that injunction by showing that they have taken all reasonable measures. According to the ECJ, measures are deemed “reasonable” provided that (i) they do not unnecessarily deprive internet users of the possibility of lawfully accessing the information available and (ii) they have the effect of preventing unauthorized access to copyrighted materials or, at least, of seriously discouraging internet users from accessing infringing materials. The ECJ disregarded a previous opinion of the Advocate General, which came down to opposite conclusions.]
 
European Court of Justice, Nils Svensson et al v Retriever Sverige AB, C-466/12, February 13, 2014
[copyright, infrigement, hosting providers, news articles, linking]
 
[The ECJ decided that links to authorized works freely available online do not infringe the E.U.-recognized exclusive right of communication to the public. The case involved journalists claiming that the website Retriever Sverige had improperly linked to news articles they had authored, thereby making those articles available to the public without permission, in violation of copyright law.
 
(1) For the first time, the ECJ announced a rule that links communicate works to the public, which is a copyright owner’s sole prerogative under EU law. However, the court said that those links are not infringing and do not need additional authorization from the copyright owner unless they make the work available to a new public (par. 25-28). A new public must include people other than those who can access the work thanks to the rightsholders’ conduct. In other words, if the rightsholder publishes the work online, anyone can link to it without further permission. 
 
(2) Next, the ECJ decided that for copyright purposes, there is no difference between a link which takes the user to another website where the work (presumably) is lawfully displayed and one which embeds the work, giving the impression that it is appearing on the linking website. Because only a link that communicates the work to a “new public” infringes the copyright holders’ exclusive right (par. 30), copyright law does not offer any redress for this practice. However, the ECJ does not exclude the possibility that courts may still sanction this practice under some circumstances as a form of unfair competition. 
 
(3) Finally, the ECJ decided that Member States are not entitled to give wider protection to authors by defining “communication to the public” more broadly than is done in the InfoSoc Directive (par. 33-41).] [See also CIS blog.]
 
European Court of Justice, ITV Broadcasting Ltd and others v TVCatchup Ltd, C-607/2011, March 7, 2013
[copyright, streaming, television programs, communication to the public, liability]
 
[(1) The ECJ was asked to decide whether sites that link to streams are responsible for communicating copyrighted works to the public. In this case, the defendant operated a website based on free, unauthorised live streaming of television programmes, including those protected by the claimant’s copyright.
 
(2) The ECJ confirmed that any retransmission of a terrestrial television broadcast over the Internet constitutes a communication to the public. In particular, the concept of ‘communication to the public’ covers a retransmission of the works included in a terrestrial television broadcast (a) where the retransmission is made by an organisation other than the original broadcaster, (b) by means of an internet stream made available to the subscribers of that other organisation who may receive that retransmission by logging on to its server, (c) even though those subscribers are within the area of reception of that terrestrial television broadcast and may lawfully receive the broadcast on a television receiver. Also, the ECJ noted that it is irrelevant whether the retrasmission (i) is funded by advertizing and is therfore of a profit-making nature or (ii) is made by an organization which is acting in direct competition with the original broadcaster.
 
European Court of Justice, Belgische Vereniging van Auteurs, Componisten en Uitgevers CVBA (SABAM) v. Netlog NV, C-360/10, February 16, 2012
[copyright, infringment, hosting provider, social network, linking, filtering, monitoring]
 
[The ECJ had to decide whether a Belgian court could require Netlog, the Belgian equivalent to Facebook, to immediately cease making available works from SABAM‘s repertoire by installing a filtering system, which would oblige Netlog to actively monitor all the data of its users and to prevent future IPR-infringements. The ECJ decided that European law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from issuing an injunction against a hosting service provider which requires it to install a system for filtering: (1) information which is stored on its servers by its service users; (2) which applies indiscriminately to all of those users; (3) as a preventative measure; (4) exclusively at its expense; and (5) for an unlimited period, (6) which is capable of identifying electronic files containing musical, cinematographic or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant for the injunction claims to hold intellectual property rights, with a view to preventing those works from being made available to the public in breach of copyright.] [See also Global FoE]
 
European Court of Justice, Scarlet Extended SA v. Société belge des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs SCRL (SABAM), C-70/10, November 24, 2011
[copyright, infringment, access provider, file sharing, p2p, filtering, monitoring]
 
[(1) The ECJ had to decide whether a Belgian collective rights managment organization (SABAM) could require an internet service provider, namely Scarlet and Tiscali, to install a filtering system with a view to preventing the illegal downloading of files.
 
(2) The ECJ ruled that EU law must must be interpreted as precluding an injunction made against an internet service provider which requires it to install a system for filtering (i) all electronic communications passing via its services, in particular those involving the use of peer-to-peer software; (ii) which applies indiscriminately to all its customers; (iii) as a preventive measure; (iv) exclusively at its expense; and (v) for an unlimited period, (vi) which is capable of identifying on that provider’s network the movement of electronic files containing a musical, cinematographic or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold intellectual-property rights, with a view to blocking the transfer of files the sharing of which infringes copyright.
 
(3) An obligation to implement such filtering system, according to the ECJ, would seriously endanger “the freedom to conduct business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs”, also possibly infringing “the fundamental rights of that ISP’s customers, namely their right to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information.”] [See also Global FoE]
 
European Court of Justice, L’Oréal SA and Others v. eBay International AG and Others, C-324/09, July 12, 2011
[trademark, infringment, hosting provider, keywords]
 
[Considering the use of keywords as a trigger for contributory liability of an hosting provider that operates an online marketplace. The ECJ found that an hosting provider cannot benefit from the E-Commerce Directive safe harbours
 
(1) if it has played an active role in relation to the sale activities of the direct infringer, or
 
(2) if it has constructive knowledge of unlawful sales carried out throughout its services.
 
(3) The Court clarified that ""awareness"" of illegal content can in particular be obtained by a notice that is ""sufficiently detailed and adequately substantiated"". A hosting service provider may thus have to act (by removing or disabling access to content) following the receipt of a notice. A notice may concern any type of illegal content.
 
(4) The ECJ interpreted Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive as meaning that an ISP may be ordered “to take measures which contribute, not only to bringing to an end infringements of those rights by users of that marketplace, but also to preventing further infringements of that kind.”] [see also Global FoE].

Centre national de recherche en relations humaines (CNRRH) SARL and Others, C-238/08, joined cases, March 23, 2010
[France, trademark, hosting provider, online advertising, auctioning, keywords]
 
[Considering the contributory liability for trademark infringement of an hosting provider auctioning words corresponding to the plantiffs' trademarks while operating an online advertising service. The ECJ found that the provider does not infringe trademark law by allowing advertisers to purchase potentially infringing keyworks trough their services. In particular, (1) a provider, which (a) stores, as a keyword, a sign identical to a trademark and (b) organizes the display of advertisements on the basis of that keyword does not use the sign within the meaning of trademark law. (2) Additionally, the safe harbors provided by Directive 2000/31/EC apply if the service provider (a) has not played an active role that gives it knowledge of, or control over, the data stored or (b) having obtained knowledge of the unlawful nature of those data or of that advertiser’s activities, it failed to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the data concerned. If (a) and (b) do not apply, that service provider cannot be held liable for the data which it has stored at the request of an advertiser.]

 
European Court of Justice, LSG v. Tele2, C-557/07, February 19, 2009
[Austria, privacy, copyright, access providers, ISPs, right of Information, IP numbers, disclosure]
 
[Performing rights organization LSG-Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten (""LSG"") asked Tele2 to disclose users’ temporary IP addresses as personal traffic data, for the purpose of civil proceedings for alleged infringements of their exclusive copyrights. The ECJ relied its reasoning heavily on the Promusicae case and stated that: (1) Access providers which merely provide users with Internet access, without offering other services or exercising any control over the services provided to users, must be regarded as intermediaries under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29; (2) under the principle of proportionality, ISPs’ duty of disclosure gives way to users’ privacy rights in this case, where temporary IP addresses must not be stored for the purpose of civil litigations in copyright infringement cases.]

 
European Court of Justice, Productores de Música de España (Promusicae) v Telefónica de España SAU,  Case C-275/06, July 16, 2009
[Spain, privacy, copyright, access providers, ISPs, right of Information, IP numbers, disclosure]
 
[Promusicae sought an order from a commercial court in Spain to force Telefónica, a Spanish ISP, to divulge identities corresponding to IP addresses that Promusicae had collected in its own investigations of illegal file sharing. The Spanish court granted Promusicae’s request. Telefónica appealed to the ECJ in regards the interpretations of the Community Law, Articles 15(2) and 18 of Directive 2000/31, Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29, Article 8 of Directive 2004/48 and Articles 17(2) and 47 of the Charter on the limits of ISPs’ responsibilities to assist in criminal investigation versus civil proceedings. Balancing ISP customers’ privacy with content industry’s ability to protect its intellectual property, theECJ held that European law alone does not require ISPs to disclose their subscribers’ identities to trade organizations for the purpose of civil litigation against the subscribers in order to ensure effective protection of copyright.] [See also Global FoE]

DECISIONS


Superior Courts


Corte di Cassazione [Supreme Court], Third Criminal Section, Google-Vividown, 5107/14, December 17,  2013
[privacy, intermediary liability, hosting provider, YouTube, criminal liability]
 
[Upholding the Milan Court of Appeal’s judgment and concluding a long dispute between the no-profit association Vividown and Google.
 
(1) Vividown brought a lawsuit against Google because it did not promptly remove a video from YouTube. The video portrayed a minor with the Down syndrome bullied by his classmates.
 
(2) For the Privacy Code article 167 “Any person who, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause harm to another, processes personal data (unlawfully) […] shall be punished, if harm is caused, by imprisonment for between six and eighteen months or, if the offence consists in data communication or dissemination, by imprisonment for between six and twenty-four months, unless the offence is more serious”.
 
(3) The first trial found Google guilty for “not preventing the crime”; the Court’s reasoning was based on a provision of the Italian Criminal Code for which “not preventing a crime is like committing it” (Art 40). The appeal reversed the judgment. The Court ruled that to be found guilty under the article 167 a wilful misconduct must occur. The Corte di Cassazione confirmed the appeal.] [See also Blog Studio Legale Finocchiaro]

 
Corte di Cassazione [Supreme Court], Third Criminal Section, ThePirateBay, 49437/09, September 29, 2009
[copyright, access provider, hosting provider, peer-to-peer, torrent site, ISPs, linking, injunction, blocking order]
 
[Endorsing a principle upon which the judiciary is entrusted with the power of ordering the intermediaries to provide a material aid to prevent further copyright infringement by blocking access to websites which are found guilty of the crime provided under Art 173-ter (2) a-bis). The court may order the preliminary seizure of the website through which the operator contributes to the criminal activity of disseminating copyrighted works on the Internet, without authorization. At the same time, the court may require that the ISPs block access to the site in order to debar the illegal dissemination of these works].
 
Corte di Cassazione [Supreme Court], Third Criminal Section, Coolstreaming and Calciolibero, 33945/06, October 10, 2006

[(1) Coolstreaming and Calciolibero facilitated access to soccer games, which were originally streamed by a Chinese broadcaster, by providing online information and links allowing viewers to connect directly to the Chinese servers.
 
(2) Initially, the first two levels of judicial review had denied any form of infringement of others’ exclusive rights through this conduct. However, the Italian Corte di Cassazione reversed.
 
(3) The Court construed indexing and linking as a contributory infringement because “undeniably, the defendants have aided and abetted, through the provision of a system of online guidance, the connection and synchronization to the sporting event; absent the defendants’ activities, the making available to the public of the protected works would not have occurred or would have occurred to a more limited extent.” In the Court’s view, the illegal conduct can be distinguished from, say, a common search engine because Coolstreaming and Calciolibero had come up with actions that causally determined the infringement by providing the users with an online guidance that made the infringement possible. In particular, the Court noted that such guidance included the provision of the necessary technical means to watch the sporting event, such as information on the software that the users had to download in order to watch the stream and links both to the software and the streamed event.]

Corte d'Appello di Milano [Court of Appeal of Milan], Civil, Reti Televisive Italiane S.p.A. (RTI) v. Yahoo! Italia S.r.l. (Yahoo!) et al., 3821/2011, January 7, 2015
[copyright, hosting provider,  videosharing, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Video, notice, monitoring]
 
[The Court of Appeal reversed an earlier decision (see below). The appelate decision clarified that RTI had the obligation to indicate in a ""detailed, precise and specific manner"" the videos that Yahoo! had to remove. Additionally, in view of the Court of Appeal, the court of first instance did not have the power to ""impose to a hosting provider general orders or, even worse, general monitoring obligations, which are forbidden by Directive 2000/31/EC."" Intermediary liability may arise only if the hosting provider does not act promptly upon a ""detailed, precise and specific"" notice. Actually, RTI never sent this notice to Yahoo!, therefore the appelate court found in favor of Yahoo! and rejected RTI's claims.] [See also CIS Blog]
 
Tribunale di Roma [Court of Rome], Civil, TMFT Enterprises LLC- Break Media v. Reti Televisive Italiane S.p.A. (RTI), April 27, 2016
 
[(1) The Court of Rome found TMFT Enterprises LLC- Break Media (""Break Media"") liable for copyright infringement for the unauthorized streaming of audiovisual content to which Reti Televisive Italiane S.p.A. (""RTI"") owned the copyright.
 
(2) The Court supported its decision basically on two arguments:
Identification of the activity of Break Media as ""active hosting"" and not just ""passive hosting"". According to the Court, Break Media is not a simple host of media content but a sophisticated content-provider. Indeed, the activity of Break Media is not limited to the activation of technical procedures for enabling the content to be loaded to the platform (""passive hosting""), but requires of a complex and sophisticated organization of advertising exploitation of the content loaded to the platform which is selected, addressed, related and associated to other contents in order to deliver to the user an audiovisual product, which has a better quality, complexity and a precise and specific autonomy (""active hosting""). As a result, the defenses of the E-Commerce Directive are not applicable, and general rules on liability apply.
Effective knowledge of Break Media of transmission of illegal files. Although the communication sent by RTI demanding Break Media the removal of the infringing content from the platform did not identify the specific URL (precise and specific location of the content to be removed), the effective knowledge of the defendant of the infringing nature of the content was enough (which in this case was evident, also by the fact that the content clearly showed the broadcaster’s trademark).
 
(3) The Court of Rome prohibited Break Media from further violating the rights of RTI by imposing a penalty of EUR 1,000 per each day of violation of such prohibition, and condemned Break Media to the payment of damages caused to RTI which were estimated in EUR 115,000 basing on an estimation of the royalties that Break Media would have had to pay for a license to stream the content. Finally, it ordered Break Media to pay expenses of the trial, and to publish the decision for two consecutive times in nation-wide printed and online magazines and in the homepage of Break Media.
 
Tribunale Regionale Amministrativo (TAR) del Lazio [Lazio Regional Administrative Tribunal], Administrative, ANSO, FEMI and Open Media Coalition v. Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM), 2184/2014, June 25, 2014
[copyright, administrative, constitutionality, AGCOM, Regulation, adminstrative enforcement, online copyright infringement]
 
[(1) The associations for the defense of freedom of information as well as those representing web-tv, micro web-tv, micromedia hyperlocal, blogs and video blogs, information portals, aggregators and video companies active in the online press are entitled to challenge AGCOM Regulations regarding Online Copyright Enforcement (AGCOM Regulation).
 
(2) The AGCOM Regulation does not primarily enforce copyright but any failure to comply with an order of the Authority. Therefore, this order cannot be considered illegitimate for (a) AGCOM's incompetence to introduce a para-judicial procedure to enforce copyright or (b) inconsistency between this procedure and the rules of law which entrust to the ordinary courts the enforcement of copyright, or even, for (c) breach of the principle of the judge previously ascertained by law in so far as judicial review of AGCOM measures is done by the administrative judge, rather than civil or criminal.
 
(3) The AGCOM Regulation does not violate EU or national law in so far as it provides that the order is addressed only to hosting and access service providers and not to uploader, manager of the page and the website operator. This is because EU and national law provide that ISPs may be subject to supervisory authorities' measures aimed at limiting the negative externalities of their activities (see Art. 8(3), Dir. 2001/29/EC and Art. 11, Dir. 2004/48/EC).
 
(4) The AGCOM Regulation does not violate the adversarial principle in so far as it provides a very short deadline for the submission of counter-arguments. Actually, this principle governs criminal and civil proceedings, and possibly administrative proceedings of contentious nature. It does not apply to purely administrative proceedings, which are governed by the principle of ""participation in the proceedings"", which can be balanced for reasons of urgency that the authority may identify.
 
(5) The question of the constitutionality of Articles 5(1), 14(3), 15(2), and 16(3), Legislative Decree 70/2003 and Article 32bis(3), Legislative Decree 177/2005, on the basis of which the AGCOM Regulation was adopted,  is not manifestly unfounded. Those provisions may infringe on (a) the principles of ""statutory reserve"" and judicial protection provided in defense of freedom of expression and economic initiative, as well as (b) the criteria of reasonableness and proportionality in the exercise of legislative discretion and (c) the principle of the natural judge, because of the lack of legal guarantees and judicial safeguards for the exercise of freedom of expression online, at least equivalent to those laid down for the press.]
 
Tribunale di Roma [Tribunal of Rome], Civil, Antonio Angelucci and Giampaolo Angelucci v. Wikimedia Foundation Inc. Italia, 70572/09, July 9, 2014
[defamation, hosting provider, Wikimedia, Angelucci, Wikipedia, user-generated content, monitoring]
 
[(1) Italian politicians Antonio Angelucci and his son claimed that Wikipedia pages related to the Angeluccis contained false statements supposedly harming the family’s reputation. The allegedly defamatory statements referred to bribery scandals involving the Angeluccis. Although, upon notice of Angelucci’s claim, Wikimedia removed the allegedly defamatory information, the Angeluccis sought €20,000,000 in damages from the Wikimedia Foundation. The plaintiffs argued that Wikimedia should be treated like a content provider, rather than hosting, and should be liable under the stricter standard that apply to the Italian press as an online journal.
  
(2) The Court of Rome rejected plaintiffs' argument and stated that Wikimedia Foundation serves as a hosting provider in managing the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Therefore, the liability standards applying to the Italian press cannot be extended to Wikimedia, as “unlike the case of press publication, there is no contractual relationship between the author of the [allegedly infringing] content and the hosting provider; and [casting liability upon] this [conduct], coupled with the enormous amount of data uploaded by users, would imply a form of objective liability that cannot find justification in the present [Italian] legal framework.” 
 
(3) In coming down to this conclusion, the Roman Court noted that, while the Directive does not directly apply to the Wikimedia Foundation as a non-EU-based organization, the basic principles of the Directive apply. According to those principles, Wikipedia enjoys an exemption from liability, as a hosting provider, unless “it does not act to remove, or block access to, the infringing information, if it gets explicit notice of this information by the competent authorities.” 
 
(4) Unlike a content provider, a hosting provider does not have any obligation to monitor the content published by its users to prevent defamation of a third party. The court stated that Wikipedia “offers a service which is based on the freedom of the users to draft the various pages of the encyclopedia; it is such freedom that excludes any [obligation to guarantee the absence of offensive content on its sites] and which finds its balance in the possibility for anybody to modify contents and ask for their removal.” 
 
(5) The court also excluded any form of liability of Wikipedia for carrying out a “dangerous activity.” Theoretically, Article 2050 of the Italian Civil Code would provide a legal basis for this type of liability. As the Court noted, this liability may follow from the “danger of uncontrolled, immediate and pervasive circulation of news that the online platform [managed by Wikimedia] may allow to an indiscriminate number of people.” However, the Court went on to state that Wikimedia was very clear in its disclaimers about its neutral role in the creation and maintenance of content. This disclaimer about the truthfulness of any statements included in Wikipedia would “exclude any involvement of the hosting provider in the defamation.”] [see also CIS Blog post.]
 
Tribunale di Roma [Tribunal of Rome], Criminal, Operation EyeMoon, July 2014
[copyright, infringment, hosting provider, video streaming, movie, EyeMoon, Mega, Mail.ru, blocking order]
 
[(1) The Tribunal of Rome ordered Internet Service Providers to block access in Italy to the ip addresses of 24 websites hosting copyrighted content without the rightsholders’ consent. (2) Acting upon a claim of a small Italian independent distributor, the Italian authorities started a large-scale anti-piracy operation, labelled “Operation EyeMoon,” that lead to the injunction issued by the Roman court. (3) The blocking order includes well known illegal movie streaming websites, such as cineblog01.net, cineblog01.tv, ddlstorage.com, divxstage.eu, easybytez.com, filminstreaming.eu, filmstream.info, firedrive.com, movshare.sx, nowdownload.ag, nowdownload.sx, nowvideo.sx, piratestreaming.net, primeshare.tv, putlocker.com, rapidvideo.tv, sockshare.com, uploadable.ch, uploadinc.com, video.tt, videopremium.me, youwatch.org. (4) However, the order also targeted Mail.ru and Mega.co.nz. Mail.ru is the most-visited Russian website and the largest Russian Internet company. As for Mega, it is a new cloud storage service created by Kim Dotcom.]
 
Tribunale di Torino [Tribunal of Turin], Civil, IP Specialized Section, Delta TV Programs S.rl. v. YouTube et al, June 23, 2014
[copyright, hosting provider, You Tube, Delta TV, videos, soap opera, notice, monitoring, content ID]
 
[Reversing en banc a previous judgment of the same Tribunal of May 5, 2014 (see below). This time, the Court accepted Delta TV’s request for interim injunction against Google and YouTube for copyright infringement of certain South American soap operas that users had uploaded to YouTube. In this case, Google complied with its notice and take down policy, and the videos were removed as soon as the specific URLs were provided by Delta TV. Nevertheless, the Court agreed with Delta TV’s claims, and ordered Google and YouTube to remove the infringing videos and to prevent further uploads of the same content through the use of its Content ID software (YouTube’s system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright) using as a reference the URLs provided by Delta TV. The Court stressed that these proactive monitoring obligations derive from the fact that YouTube is a “new generation” hosting service, a role that brought on it a greater responsibility to protect third parties’ rights.]

 
Tribunale di Torino [Tribunal of Turin], Civil, IP Specialized Section, Delta TV Programs S.rl. v. YouTube et al, May 5, 2014
[copyright, hosting provider, You Tube, Delta TV, videos, soap opera, notice, active host]
 
[Rejecting Delta TV’s request for interim injunction against YouTube for copyright infringement on certain South American soap operas which had been uploaded by YouTube users. Delta TV sued Google and YouTube and filed for an interim injunction asking the Court to order Google to remove the infringing videos, prohibiting further violations and imposing a penalty of EUR 1,000 per day for each violation of the Court’s order. However, the Court rejected the request on the basis that (i) there is no obligation on the part of Google and YouTube, as hosting providers, to assess the actual ownership of the copyrights in videos uploaded by individual users, (ii) the only liability hypothetically attributable to Google and YouTube relates to cases where they are specifically informed of the unlawfulness of the uploaded videos and have not removed them (while in this case the videos were removed as soon as the specific URLs were provided by Delta TV), and (iii) there do not exist sufficient evidence to consider Google and YouTube as “active hosts” (thus not shielded by the hosting defence of the E-Commerce Decree). The Court further clarified that in order to trigger the obligation of the hosting provider to remove the infringing videos, it is necessary for the copyright owner to specify the exact URLs where the videos are accessible online.]
 
Tribunale di Milano [Tribunal of Milan], Criminal, Lega Calcio, July 19, 2013
[copyright, criminal infringement, streaming, linking, sport events, blocking order]
 
[Ordering Internet Service Providers to block access within Italy to all present and future IP numbers associated with the Rojadirecta domain names, a website linking to football games streamed online without authorization. The criminal prosecution was started upon a claim of the Italian Soccer Association, since the unlawful streaming infringed  its exclusive rights to broadcast the games. As in a similar decision of January 12, 2013, the order was based on Article 171, paragraph 1, letter a-bis of the Italian Copyright Law (see below).]
 
Tribunale di Roma [Tribunal of Rome], Civil, IP Specialized Section, Reti Televisive Italiane v. Il Post, 15055/13, July 16, 2013
[copyright, hosting provider, news website, illegal streaming, linking, freedom of the press, freedom of expression]
 
[Ruling that by providing links to streaming services, an Italian news website had infringed on copyrights owned by a major Italian media company in relation to the broadcasting of football matches. Although a simple item of information indicating the availability of streaming football matches websites may constitute the legitimate exercise of right of freedom of the press, the systematic and repeated posting. Using links to matches about to start had the effect of offering to the public a tool for the immediate and easy identification of sites where they can see the event for free. The Court of Rome prohibited the provision, in any way, of information on the name and how to access the websites allowing the unlawful streaming of the Italian media company’s content].
 
Tribunale di Roma [Tribunal of Rome], Civil, IP Specialized Section, Previti v. Wikimedia, 12262/13, June 20, 2013
[defamation, hosting provider, Wikipedia, liability, hosting exemption]
 
[Ruling against the plaintiff - who claimed that Wikipedia was responsible for the inaccurate and defamatory statements posted by individual users on the page devoted to him. The court found that, according to the Italian E-commerce Decree, Wikimedia must be considered a hosting provider, and therefore cannot be liable for the content created by users. The Court concluded that Wikimedia is clear about its role as a hosting provider by means of a general disclaimer and that, while the system is based on users’ freedom to provide entries and add content, the same is balanced by the possibility for anyone to edit errors, modify undesirable content and to ask for its elimination through the community review processes].
 
Tribunale di Milano [Tribunal of Milan], Civil, Paoletti et all v. Google, 68306/12, March 25, 2013
[defamation, search engine, Google Autocomplete, liability, caching exemption] 
 
[Reversing its previous decision of March 24, 2011 on the liability of search engines for the results generated by the ""auto-complete"" function. The court resoned that those results are not ""stored not structured, organized or influenced by Google, which simply analyzes their polularity and releases them through automatic software on the basis of an algorithm""; therefore, Google cannot be considered a ""content provider"" but is instead a catching service, intended to facilitate users' access to online information, and as such exempted from liability for the information it stores; the decision was delivered in connection with a damage claim against Google on the basis that its ""auto-complete"" function predicted defamatory words when a user begun to enter the name of the plaintiff or his industry association].
 
Tribunale di Milano [Tribunal of Milan], Criminal, Reti Televisive Italiane, January 12, 2013
[copyright, criminal infringement, access provider, ISP, streaming, linking, sport events, blocking order]
 
[Ordering Internet Service Providers to block access to 10 websites streaming football games without authorization upon a claim of the main Italian private broadcaster (RTI-Mediaset), since the unlawful streaming infringed its exclusive rights to broadcast the games. The order was on Article 171-ter (2) a-bis of the Italian Copyright Law, which punishes with a criminal fine whomever makes available to the public 1a copyrighted work by inserting it into a computer system, without authorization, through connections of any type. In particular, the court specified that football games, per se, may not be considered as copyrighted works, while video recordings of the same, characterized by a specific technical and creative contribution, may be considered as such].
 
Tribunale di Milano [Tribunal of Milan], Criminal, Mondadori, November 22, 2012
[copyright, criminal infringement, access providers, ISP, handling of stolen goods, newspapers, linking, blocking order]
 
[At the request of Italy’s largest publishing company, Mondadori, the court ordered all Italian Internet Service Providers to block access within the Italian terriory to Avaxhome.ws, a popular website featuring links posted by users to online services hosting PDF copies of worldwide newspapers. The order was based not only on criminal copyright infringement, but also on the crime of handling stolen goods. This could imply that not only the website operators but also the website users might risk criminal consequences for posting links].
 
Tribunale di Milano [Tribunal of Milan], Civil, Reti Televisive Italiane S.p.A. (RTI) v. Yahoo! Italia S.r.l. (Yahoo!) et al., 3821/11, September 9, 2011
[copyright, hosting provider, videosharing, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Video, notice, monitoring]
 
[The Court of Milan found Yahoo! liable for copyright infringement. Infringement supposedly occurred with the publication of fragments of television programs through the now deceased Yahoo! Video service. The Court stated that the hosting safe harbor of the E-Commerce Directive could not be applied where the service is not a mere passive hosting of users' data, but is instead an ""active hosting"".]
 
Tribunale di Roma [Tribunal of Rome], Civil, IP Specialized Section, Reti Televisive Italiane v. Rojadirecta, August 17, 2011
[copyright, hosting provider, illegal streaming, sport events, linking]
 
[Concluding that Rojadirecta “consciously and willfully” aided and abetted the infringement of the right to broadcasting sporting events because the links, which may in itself be legit, were integrated in a broader activity facilitating and contributing to the infringement of the exclusive rights of the rightholders. Rojadirecta had  knowledge of the unlawfulness of its actions with the clear goal of commercially exploiting the broadcasted sporting events through the placement of advertisements].

Privacy Authority (""Garante"") Decision about the Publication on a Newspaper Bulletin Board of Personal Data concerning Heath, doc. web n. 1821322, May 19, 2011
[privacy, hosting provider, bulletin board, right to access personal data and other right]
 
[The claimant asked the newspaper to remove the message herself posted on the board. She claimed she was not aware of the public nature of the board and she deemed her post reviling sensitive data about her health. The Garante intimated to the newspaper to remove the claimant post. The newspaper initially failed to remove the post which was later deleted after further requests. The newspaper was responsible for the payment of the proceeding costs (about 500 Euros)]
 

Privacy Authority (""Garante"") Decision about the Request of Deleting a “Tag” from a Facebook Picture, doc. web n. 1712776, 18 February 2010
[privacy, hosting provider, facebook pictures, sensitive data, tag]
 
[The claimant requested to force Facebook to remove of a “tag” from a Facebook photo able to identify her and her sexual orientation. The Garante rejected the complaint because the law does not apply if (a) the profile data processing was carried out only for personal use (b) there is not “diffusion”: the profile was “closed” and therefore there was not diffusion to the public (c) the claimant can autonomously remove the tag.]

[The claimant was seeking to remove an article concerning an investigation about him dated 1993. The claimant was later found innocent in connection with the investigation described in the article. The articles were still available online. The Privacy Authority rejected the complaint against Google for lack of jurisdiction because the “data processing” through cache copies does not take place in Italy nor in any European country.]

LEGISLATION


Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998, 17 U.S.C. § 512
 
[Creating safe harbors for ISPs against monetary liability for copyright infringing material posted or sent through an intermediary’s system. Unlike §230, DMCA safe harbors don’t prevent suit for injunctive relief against an intermediary nor protect all Internet intermediaries except the four classes of intermediaries: conduit providers such as telephone companies, those who store or cache content hosted by another, and those who host content posted by another, and search engines. Safe harbor is available only to an intermediary that “does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity.” To benefit from the safe harbors, intermediaries must establish, publicize and implement both a notice and takedown system for removing alleged infringing content and a system to identify and remove repeating infringers.]
 
Communications Decency Act 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 230(c) 
 
[The Act provides that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law.] 
 
Trademark Act 1946, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2), §32(2)
 
[Providing a safe harbor from trademark infringement for publishers, which is also extended to online providers of content written by another.]


BILLS AND PENDING PROPOSALS
Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) of 2011, H.R. 3261, introduced in the House on October 26, 2011 (postponed)
 
[(1) This Bill was introduced to provide new tools to enforce online copyright infringment. These measures applied to ""foreign infinging sites"". This definition includes (i) U.S.-directed sites used by users in the United States; (ii) whose owners or operators are committing or facilitating the commission of criminal violations; and (iii) which would be subject to seizure in the United States in an action brought by the Attorney General if such site were a domestic Internet site.
 
(2) The most relevant enforcement tools included (i) the requesting of court orders requiring Internet service providers to block access to the websites (ii) the requesting of court orders barring search engines from linking to the infringing websites, (iii) court orders barring advertising networks and payment facilities from conducting business with infringing websites, and (iv) expansion of existing criminal laws to include unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content, imposing a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
 
(3) After a wave of protests, culminated in the Internet Blackout on January 18, 2012, the House Judiciary Committee postponed consideration of the bill.] [See also SOPA & PIPA EFF page]
 
Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP Act or PIPA) of 2011, S. 968, introduced in the Senate on May 12, 2011 (postponed)
 
[This Bill is the Senate version of SOPA and a rewrite of COICA (see below). The Bill would give the US government and copyright holders additional tools to enhance ""enforcement against rogue websites operated and registered overseas,"" which are dedicated to the sale of infringing or counterfeit goods.  The Senate Judiciary Committee passed the Bill, which was later placed on hold after a wave of protests from civil sopciety and tech industry (see above).] [See also SOPA & PIPA EFF page]
 
Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) of 2010, S. 3804, introduced in the Senate on November 18, 2010 (withdrawn)
 
[authorizing the Attorney General to bring an in rem action against any domain name ""dedicated to infringing activities."" Upon obtaining an order for relief, the registrar of, or registry affiliated with, the infringing domain would be compelled to ""suspend operation of and lock the domain name."" The bill passed the Senate judiciary Committee but, after negative public reaction, never received a full vote at the Senate. It was later resubmitted with amendments as the Protect IP Act.] 


DECISIONS


[For a complete coverage of cases applying Section 230 and other Internet cases, please see Professor Eric Goldman's Technology and Marketing Law Blog and Electronic Frontier Foundation's legal cases.]
Supreme Court



American Broadcasting Cos., Inc. v. Aereo, Inc., 110 U.S.P.Q.2d 1961, 42 Med. L. Rptr. 1885 (U.S. 2014)
[Cable Services, Public Performance, Direct Liability, Secondary Liability]
 
[holding that “Aereo publicly performs copyrighted works, in violation of the Copyright Act’s Transmit Clause, when it sells its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air.” However, the dissenting opinion argued that turning a secondary liability case into a direct liability case is a mistake and may work serious injury to the general public. Justice Scalia strongly objected to the majority view and noted that “Aereo does not perform at all. The Court manages to reach the opposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted rules for service-provider [ . . . ] liability and adopting in their place an improvised standard (""looks-like-cable-TV"") that will sow confusion for years to come.”] [See CIS blog post]
 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 125 S. Ct. 2764, 162 L. Ed. 2d 781 (2005)
[copyright, infringment, software, P2P file sharing, secondary infringment]
 
[Songwriters, music publishers, and motion studios brought copyright infringement action against distributors of a P2P file sharing computer networking software. The Supreme Court held that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.]
 
Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984)
[copyright, infringment, device manufacturer, secondary liability, contributory liability, time shifting]
 
[Universal brought an action against Sony alleging that video tape recorder (VTRs) consumers had been recording some of Universal’s copyrighted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and thereby infringed on their copyrights, and further that Sony was liable for such copyright infringement because of their marketing of the VTRs. The Supreme Court held that ""[t]he sale of the VTR's to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of [Universal's] copyrights."" The Court concluded that there was a significant likelihood that a substantial number of copyright holders who license their works for free public broadcasts would not object to having their broadcasts time-shifted by private viewers and that Universal failed to show that time-shifting would cause non-minimal harm to the potential market for, or the value of, their copyrighted works. ]
 


Lower Courts


Capitol Records LLC et al v. Vimeo LLC et al, No. 14-1048 (2nd Cir. 2016)
[copyright, hosting provider, user generated content, music, video, red flag]
 
[Video-sharing website Vimeo LLC cannot be held liable for copyright infringement for unknowingly hosting older music (pre-1972) uploaded by its users. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York held that the safe harbors provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) protect qualifying website operators from liability from such pre-1972 recordings, even though they are not covered by federal copyright law. The Court also held that the mere fact that Vimeo employees had viewed videos with copyrighted sound recordings was not enough to prove the company ignored red flags of infringement]. 
 
Stephanie Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 5:07-cv-03783-JF (9th Cir. 2015)
[copyright, hosting provider, user generated content, notice, take down, fair use]
 
[(1) The Court gave some breathing space to creators of User-Generated Content (UGC) from bogus takedown notices in cases of blatant misrepresentation of fair use defences by copyright holders and held that “the statute requires copyright holders to consider fair use before sending take-down notification.”  
 
(2) The Court also recognised the possible applicability of section 512(f) of the DMCA that allows for the recognition of damages in case of proved bad-faith, which would occur if the copyright holder did not consider fair use or paid “lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary.” However, the Court noted also that there’s no liability under § 512(f), “[i]f, however, a copyright holder forms a subjective good faith belief the allegedly infringing material does not constitute fair use.”]
 
Backpage.com, LLC v Thomas J. Dart, Sheriff of Cook County, No. 15-3047 (7th Cir. 2015)
[public order, public moral, decency, free speech, payment provider, Visa, Mastercard, hosting provider, Backpage, online advertising]
 
[(1) The Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois in an attempt to shut down Backpage.com’s advertising of sexual services sent a letter to Visa and MasterCard, demanding the companies to ""immediately cease and desist from allowing . . . credit cards to be used to place ads on websites like Backpage.com."" Visa and MasterCard complied and refused to process credit card transactions to purchase any ads on the website, including those for other services. (2) Backpage then filed a preliminary injunction against the Sheriff, but it was denied by the Northern District Court of Illinois. (3) On appeal, Judge Posner from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found the Sheriff in violation of the website's First Amendment right through ""threatened imposition of government power or sanction"" in an attempt to stifle protected forms of speech. According to Posner's decision, First Amendment protected platforms and intermediaries from government threats and coercion to remove unwanted speech.] [See also Columbia GFE]
 
Garcia v. Google, Inc., 743 F. 3d 1258 (9th Cir. 2014)
[copyright, infringement, performance, video removal, Innocence of the Muslims]
 
[The footage of an actress' minor role in an unreleased adventure film titled “Desert Warrior”, was modified and incorporated into an anti-Islamic film titled the ""Innocence of the Muslims"", which was later uploaded to Youtube. The actress then received death threats from an Egyptian cleric. After Google refused to take it down from Youtube, plaintiff actress sought a restraining order seeking removal and that posting of the video infringed the copyright in her performance. 9th Circuit Judge Kozinski ruled for the actress, holding that she had an independent copyright interest in her performance (although filmmaker had an implied license to use her performance, the filmmaker exceeded the bounds of the license); and that the actress faced irreparable harm absent an injunction.]
 
UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC, 718 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2013)
[copyright, DMCA, hosting provider, Veoh, music publisher, direct liability, contributory liability, vicarious liability, inducement]
 
[Music publisher brought action against operator of publicly accessible website, Veoh, which enabled users to share videos with other users and website’s investors, alleging direct and secondary copyright infringement. District court dismissed the claims against investors and granted summary judgment to website operator. Circuit judge held that Veoh was entitled to the DMCA safe harbor protection, that is the site has no obligation to police for infringing content on its site, and that publishers failed to state claims against investors for contributory infringement, vicarious liability and inducement of infringement.]
 
Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc., 934 F.Supp.2d 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)
[copyright, infringement, first-sale doctrine, digital music, cloud computing]
 
[Capitol Records (CR), a record company, sued ReDigi, which operated an online marketplace for buying and selling pre-owned legally downloaded music, for copyright infringement regarding reproduction and distribution rights in sound recordings owned by CR. The Court held in favour of the plaintiff-copyright holder and rejected ReDigi’s “first sale” and “fair use” defenses. The Court sustained that Redigi's directly infringed CR's copyrights. In particular, the Court held that (1) ReDigi’s making unauthorized transfers of digital music files over the internet was reproduction and distribution for the purpose of copyright protection; (2) the “first sale” doctrine did not cover ReDigi’s distribution of CR’s copyrighted works; (3) ReDigi was also liable for contributory infringement and vicarious infringement of CR’s copyrights.]
 
Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 2012)
[copyright, DMCA, hosting provider, video-sharing website, YouTube]
 
[Viacom, owners of copyrighted videos field infringement action against owner and operator of website that allowed users to upload video files free of charge. Second circuit held that actual knowledge or awareness of facts or circumstances that indicated specific and identifiable instances of infringement was required to disqualify online service provider from DMCA safe harbor.]
 
Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3Tunes, LLC, 821 F.Supp.2d 627 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)
[copyright, infringement, DMCA, hosting provider, cloud computing]
 
[(1) Capitol Records, which owns copyrights in sound recordings, musical compositions, and images of album cover art, sued MP3Tunes, an online music storage service provider whose website allows users to store music files in their personal online music “lockers."" On MP3Tunes, users can search for and transfer songs to their lockers. (2) The Court held in favor of MP3Tunes. The Court found that MP3Tunes qualified for safe harbor under DMCA, except when the songs were transferred from certain unauthorized websites. In this regard the Court noted that “[i]f enabling a party to download infringing material was sufficient to create liability, then even search engines like Google or Yahoo! would be without DMCA protection. In that case, the DMCA’s purpose — innovation and growth of internet services — would be undermined."" (3) However, the Court also noted that MP3Tunes had actual knowledge of its users had stored and continued to have access to the infringing works, and it materially contributed to its users’ infringement when it failed to remove the infringing songs after receiving takedown notices.]
 
Doe v. MySpace, Inc., 528 F.3d 413 (5th Cir. 2008)
[assault, liability, social network, CDA, minor ]
 
[Social networking site, Myspace faced a claim for liability arising from an assault on a minor by a nineteen-year-old man whom she met through MySpace. Family of the girl sued Myspace for negligence in not verifying her age during registration. The Fifth Circuit held that Myspace is protected under §230 of Communication Decency Act.]
 
Perfect 10 v. Amazon.com, 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007)
[copyright, infringment, search engine, thumbnails, direct liability, secondary liability]
 
[Perfect 10, an adult entertainment magazine providing a subscription-only service online. Third party website publishers posted Perfect 10’s images on their own sites and were searchable on Google, violating Perfect 10’s terms of service as well as copyright. Perfect 10 sued Google for framing and hyperlinking to those websites on their image search service. The Court held Google not liable and Google’s search constituted a fair use of Perfect 10’s images because the use was highly transformative.]
 
RIAA v. Verizon Internet Services, 351 F.3d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 2003)
[copyright, access provider, ISP, p2p, conduit, DMCA 512(h)]
 
[Record Industry Association of America (“RIAA”) served, Verizon, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with subpoena under DMCA 512(h), seeking to identify subscribers whom it believed had infringed their members’ copyrights by trading large amount of digital music files via P2P file sharing programs. RIAA filed motion to compel production. The District Court granted RIAA's motion, denied Verizon’s motion to quash and ordered to disclose the identity of the subscribers. The Court of Appeal reversed and remanded with instructions that Verizon is acting as a conduit for p2p file sharing, which does not involve the storage of infringing material on its servers.]
 
A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001)
[copyright, p2p file sharing, software producer, direct liability, vicarious liability]
 
[Record companies and music publishers brought copyright infringement action against Napster, an Internet service that facilitated the transmission and retention of digital audio files by its users. Circuit judge held injunctive relief was proper to impose duty to provide notice of copyright status upon plaintiffs, duty on service to search for copyrighted works that were subject of notice given by plaintiffs, and courts can require ISPs to use new filtering mechanism.]

LEGISLATION

Deregulation Act 2015 c. 20
 
[Section 56 of this Act repeals sections 17 and 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010 (which warranted the introduction of specific website blocking injunctions, see below)].
 
Serious Crime Act 2015 c. 9
 
[Section 69(1) of the Act provides that “it is an offence to be in possession of any item that contains advice or guidance about abusing children sexually.” Schedule 3 of the same legislative instrument specifies that this offence is to cover the domestic providers of information society services; unless they fall within one of the safe harbours reflecting the E-Commerce Directive 2000/31 (mere conduit, caching, hosting). Non-domestic providers can also be charged, but only if a specific public policy requires it.]
 
Regulations 2013/3028, Defamation (Operators of Websites)
 
[These regulations are supplementary to section 5 of the Defamation Act 2013 (see below). Among others, they specify the characteristics of a valid notice of infringement, as well as require the website operators wishing to rely on the section 5 defence to respond to such a notice (by eg. removing the content complained of or by contacting its poster) within 48 hours (see Schedule 1 of the Regulations). That said, reg. 5 provides that the courts have the discretion to extend this period.]
 
Defamation Act 2013 c. 26
 
[Section 5 of the Act sets out a new defence from liability in defamation, for the benefit of website operators. By virtue of this provision, such intermediaries are exempt from liability for defamatory statements uploaded onto their websites by the websites’ users. However, this defence can be overcome if the claimant proves: that it was not possible for the claimant to identify the person who posted the statement, that the claimant gave the operator a notice of complaint in relation to the statement, and that the operator failed to respond to the notice of complaint in accordance with any provision contained in regulations which are to be established under section 5(5) of the Act (see above).]
 
Digital Economy Act 2010 c. 24
 
[The DEA 2010 introduced two key procedures aimed at reducing online piracy through the “graduated response” approach – procedures labelled as the “initial obligations” and the “obligations to limit Internet access”.
 
(1) The first procedure starts with a copyright owner accessing one of the P2P filesharing networks, and attempting to find and download a file to which he owns the copyright. Once he succeeds, he is supposed to record the IP address of the user who made the copyrighted file available, and send it to this user's ISP in the form of a Copyright Infringement Report (CIR). By virtue of s. 3 of the Act, the ISP is then required to forward this CIR to the allegedly infringing user. Should a user receive more than three CIRs, each of them separated from another by a specific period of time, he is to be put on this ISP's “copyright infringement list”. By virtue of s. 4, the copyright owner may demand the ISP to provide him with an anonymous list of all users who reached the threshold by infringing his copyright. Upon receiving the list, the copyright owner may then apply for a court injunction to identify the infringing users and commence infringement proceedings against them.
 
(2) The second procedure, known as the “obligations to limit Internet access”, is to be implemented only if the Secretary of State decides that the initial obligations regime does not perform sufficiently well in reducing online piracy, after at least a year of operation. This second procedure would impose an obligation on the ISPs to act upon the Internet connection of its subscribers who reached the threshold of CIRs or went above it. This could potentially include measures such as limiting the speed of the connection, preventing the subscriber from accessing certain online services, and (in the ultimate case) suspending the subscriber's connection altogether. However, none of the two procedures has actually been implemented.
 
(3) The initial obligations code, governing the operational aspects of the discussed procedures, has not appeared yet. Moreover, after a series of setbacks, the UK government announced that the initial obligations regime is to be activated in the second half of 2015.
 
(4) In addition to the “graduated response” procedures, section 17 of the DEA 2010 provides that the Secretary of State may introduce regulations explicitly providing the courts with an option of granting a blocking injunction against a “location on the internet” (most commonly, a website) which the court sees as “(…) being, or (…) likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright.” The online service provider who received the blocking injunction would have to “prevent its service being used to gain access” such a location. However, such regulations haven’t been established yet, and section 17 itself is potentially a subject to removal within the Draft Deregulation Bill 2013, clause 26 of which proposes omitting sections 17 and 18 of the DEA 2010.]
 
Electronic Commerce Regulations 2002/2013
 
[The E-Commerce Regulations implement the E-Commerce Directive into the UK law, with the three liability “safe harbours” being transplanted through regs. 17, 18 and 19 of the Regulations in an almost mirrored manner. A potentially noteworthy difference in the language of those sections is that while the Directive uses the expression “should not be liable” (in relation to intermediaries), the Regulations expand this phrase into protection from liability “for damages or for any other pecuniary remedy or for any criminal sanction”, so that various forms of injunctive relief are excluded from the implemented provision.]
 
Defamation Act 1996 c. 31
 
[Section 1 of the Defamation Act sets out a defence against liability in defamation, on which online intermediaries might try to rely on. Section 1 states that a defendant in defamation proceedings is protected from liability, provided that “he was not the author, editor or publisher of the statement complained of, he took reasonable care in relation to its publication, and he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement.” It’s worth to add that the term publisher is further defined in section 1(2) as “a commercial publisher, that is, a person whose business is issuing material to the public, or a section of the public, who issues material containing the statement in the course of that business.”]
 
Trademarks Act 1994 c. 26
 
[This piece of legislation implements the Council Directive 89/104/EEC, and in doing so, sets out in section 10 what counts as trademark infringement within the UK law. This provision might affect intermediaries such as online auction and shopping websites.]
 
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 c. 48
 
[The sizeable CDPA 1988 contains quite a few provisions related to intermediary liability. First of all, Sections 16 to 26 set out the definitions of various copyright infringing acts – those which might be of particular interest to online intermediaries are for example section 16(2) (dealing with the concept of authorisation of infringement) or section 20 (covering communication to the public). Secondly, Section 97A provides the basis for injunctions against providers of information society services. Finally, Section 107 covers the types of copyright-infringing conduct leading to criminal liability, quite a few of which could be potentially applied to online intermediaries.]

 

Self-Regulation

Creative Content UK, July 19, 2014
 
[A programme based on the “notice & notice” variant of the graduated response approach. UK ISPs have agreed to send educational notices to P2P filesharers who are found by the copyright holders to share the latters’ content online.] [See also UK Gov Press Release]


BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

Deregulation Bill 2013
 
[Passed into law with the Deregulation Act 2015].

DECISIONS


Superior Courts

CBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc [1988] UKHL 15
[copyright, liability, tape recorder, freedom of expression]
 
[The decision in CBS v Amstrad is a leading authority on joint tort liability and authorisation liability of intermediaries facilitating the copyright-infringing actions of their users. In this case, a manufacturer and seller of hi-fi equipment (which allowed its users to copy music from one tape to another) was found to be not liable for its customers’ infringing use of said equipment. While this case comes from the “analogue era”, it continues to influence the decisions concerning online intermediaries; for example, it was the key authority considered in the first Newzbin case (see below).]
 

Lower Courts


Cartier International Ltd v British Telecommunications Plc [2016] EWHC 339 (Ch)
[trademark, hosting provider, access provider, ISPs, infringement, blocking order]
 
[A blocking injunction was awarded against several further websites which facilitated the trade in goods infringing the claimant’s trademark; the criteria set out in the first Cartier case were successfully applied. It is worth to note that the possibility of the blocked IP address being shared with a website devoid of illicit activities (a matter which arose in the [2014] EWHC 3765 Cartier decision, see below) received the court’s attention – in such a scenario, the blockade may be limited to the targeted website’s domain name.]
 
Mosley v Google [2015] EWHC 59 (QB) 
[privacy, indexing service, filtering, safe harbours]
 
[The claimant brought a claim against Google under art. 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 in order to oblige the search engine to disable access to pictures infringing on the former’s privacy. Google sought to strike out the claim, on the basis that the order applied for would be incompatible with arts. 13 and 15 of the E-Commerce Directive. The court, after noting that Google is able to block access to individual child pornography images, allowed the claim to go to trial.]
 
Google Inc v Vidal-Hall [2015] EWCA Civ 311 
[privacy, indexing service, tracking cookies, jurisdiction]
 
[Google was found to be using tracking cookies in order to secretly obtain data about its users’ online activity. A group of the latter sought to obtain corresponding damages for distress suffered, on the basis of s. 13 of the Data Protection Act 1998. At first instance, the claimants have been granted the permission for the trial to be conducted in England. On appeal, after stating that misuse of private information is a valid tort for the purpose of serving out of jurisdiction and that the claim could be for non-pecuniary loss, the court upheld the lower instance judgement.]
 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v Sky UK Ltd [2015] EWHC 1082 (Ch) 
[copyright, torrent site, streaming, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[The claimants applied for a “Newzbin 2” blocking order against websites which made available and facilitated the use of the so called Popcorn Time applications (used for BitTorrent-based, illegal streaming of copyrighted content). The order was granted, with the websites’ owners found jointly liable for the infringements and the Popcorn Time application being characterised as having no legitimate purpose.]
 
1967 v B Sky B [2014] EWHC 3444 (Ch)
[copyright, torrent site, blocking order, ISPs, liability] 
 
[Another “Newzbin 2” injunction case – an application was granted against 21 torrent websites. It is worth to add that the CJEU case C-466/12 Svensson, and its impact on the notion of communication to the public were distinguished; however, it was stated that the European court’s decision did not change the legal steps required to obtain the “Newzbin 2” injunctions in the UK.]
 
Clark v TripAdvisor LLC [2014] CSIH 110
[defamation, online reviews, disclosure of users’ data, jurisdiction]
 
[A Scottish case, in which the claiming guest house owners were refused a court order which would oblige TripAdvisor - a US-based company – to disclose the personal data of users who wrote allegedly defamatory reviews about the claimant’s establishment. The base of the refusal was that the Scottish Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1972 did not cover the identification requests aimed at entities located outside of the country.]
 
Omnibill (PTY) Ltd v Egpsxxx Ltd (In Liquidation) [2014] EWHC 3762 (IPEC)
[copyright, pictures, jurisdiction]
 
[An owner of a website advertising escort services in South Africa found out that the UK copyright-protected pictures from his website were placed on his competitor’s website. The latter party was found to have infringed the copyright in pictures, as it was held that his website was targeted at the UK audience. The factors leading to this finding included the website’s language (English), the traffic data (10% to 25% visitors came from UK) and the website’s structure (composed of national sub-domains, connected to each other). The works were found to be communicated to the UK public.]
 
Cartier International AG v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd [2014] EWHC 3765 (Ch)
[trademark, infringement, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[A case following the initial Cartier decision. It was found that the IP address-based blockade of websites targeted in the initial court order may disable access to other websites using the same IP address.  The claimants submitted that this is appropriate for situations where those other websites are also involved in “unlawful activities”, and that it is appropriate to automatically block them together with the initial site; but only if the former are “certified as engaging in unlawful activity”. The ISPs attempted to challenge such an extended blocking order on the grounds that: the court had no jurisdiction, that the term “unlawful activity” was too broad and unclear, that it’s not appropriate for the IP rightsholders to decide on which websites should be seen as sufficiently “unlawful”, and that it is inconsistent to ask for the proof of the initial website’s unlawful character in court, and not do the same for the other websites on the same IP address. All four lines of inquiry were dismissed and the extended blocking order was held to be valid.]

 
Cartier International AG v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd [2014] EWHC 3354 (Ch)
[trademark, infringement, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[A UK court issued a blocking order in  a case involving an attempt to combat trademark infringement rather than copyright infringement. The Court noted that there is no statutory counterpart in the field of trademarks to Sections 97A of the UK Copyright Act. However, the Court granted the injunction construing the Court's general jurisdiction to issue injunctions in the context of Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive. The following criteria were identified for the grant of such an injunction – (1) the ISP receiving the order has to be an intermediary, (2) trademark infringement had to occur on the targeted website (3) the targeted website had to rely on the ISP’s service, (4) the ISP must have  had the actual knowledge of the infringements in question. This was the first instance in Europe that a court ordered access providers to block access to a website for trademark infringement.] [See also CIS blog}
 
Paramount Home Entertainment International Ltd v British Sky Broad-casting Ltd [2013] EWHC 3479 (Ch)
[copyright, streaming, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[A successful application for a “Newzbin 2” blocking injunction against two streaming websites (SolarMovie and TubePlus), which were found to facilitate copyright-infringing activities.]

 
EMI Records Ltd v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd [2013] EWHC 379 (Ch)
[copyright, torrent site, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[A successful application for a “Newzbin 2” blocking injunction aimed at three torrent websites (KickassTorrents, H33t and Fenopy) and made against six largest ISPs in the UK.]
 

Tamiz v Google Inc [2013] EWCA Civ 68
[defamation, blog, blog comments, liability, defence]
 
[The claimant in those proceedings complained about the defamatory comments posted on a blog hosted on Blogger.com, a website operated by Google. It was held that once Google is notified of the defamatory comments on Blogger and fails to remove them within a reasonable time, it might incur liability as the “secondary” publisher of said content. Regarding the defence set out in s. 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 (see above), it was held that Google could not be regarded as the publisher of the comments within the meaning of s. 1(2), and while the company was found to have taken reasonable care with regards to the publication of the statement, it could be denied the defence due to the finding that it knew or should have known that its activity is likely to prolong the publication of the defamatory material. However, the s. 1 defence was not applied in the end, since the Court of Appeal agreed with the court of the first instance that the damage caused by the defamatory comments at hand was of trivial character, and could not result in the finding of a real and substantial tort. Hence, the case was struck out.]
 
Football Association Premier League Ltd v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd & Others [2013] EWHC 2058 (Ch)
[copyright, streaming, sport events, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[A successful application for a “Newzbin 2” blocking injunction against a football streaming website known as FirstRow Sports, which was found to facilitate copyright-infringing activities.] [See also]
 
Dramatico Entertainment v British Sky Broadcasting (No. 2) [2012] EWHC 1152 (Ch)
[copyright, torrent site, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[A successful application made against six largest ISPs in the UK for a “Newzbin 2” blocking injunction (see below) aimed at The Pirate Bay.]
 
Dramatico Entertainment Ltd v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd (No. 1) [2012] EWHC 268 (Ch)
[copyright, torrent site, liability]
 
[Both users and operators of The Pirate Bay were found to be engaging in activities infringing the claimants’ copyrights. A preliminary case to the (No. 2) described above.]
 
Davison v Habeeb and others [2011] EWHC 3031 (QB)
[defamation, blog, liability, hosting exemption]
 
[This case concerned a defamatory blog post which appeared on Blogger.com, a website operated by Google. The claimant sought to make Google liable as a publisher of the defamatory statement. Despite the case having been ultimately dismissed due to there being no “real and substantial tort” (only five people were proven to have accessed the defamatory statement), the court found that - at least following the notification - Google can be liable for the defamatory statements posted on Blogger, as a publisher. It’s also worth to add that the court decided that Google could be protected in this case by the “hosting” safe harbour set out in reg. 19 of the E-Commerce Regulations 2002 (see above).]
 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp v British Telecommunications plc [2011] EWHC 1981 (Ch)
[copyright, Usenet, indexing service, blocking order, ISPs]
 
[The “Newzbin 2” case. Shortly after the decision in Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp v Newzbin Ltd [2010] (described below), the Usenet indexing service was reactivated as Newzbin2. Upon noticing the reinstatement of the convicted website, Fox and other copyright owners successfully applied for a blocking injunction against Newzbin2, based on section 97A of the CDPA 1988 (see above). The requested injunction was aimed at forcing BT (the largest ISP in UK) to prevent its subscribers from accessing the Newzbin2 website.]
 

ITV Broadcasting Ltd v TV Catchup Ltd [2011] EWHC 1874 (Pat) 
[copyright, streaming, television programs, communication to the public, liability] 
 
[The defendant operated a website based on free, unauthorised live streaming of television programmes; including those protected by the claimant’s copyright. It was provisionally decided that the defendant’s service did infringe upon the right of communication to the public and the right to reproduction; however the court decided to refer a series of questions to the CJEU, which were covered in the case C-607/11 ITV Broadcasting Ltd v TV Catchup Ltd. The CJEU is currently considering a further reference made in the same proceedings.]

 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp v Newzbin Ltd [2010] EWHC 608 (Ch)
[copyright, Usenet, indexing service, liability]
 
[Known as the “Newzbin 1” case. The operators of a Usenet indexing website (which was found to have been used for the illegal exchange of copyrighted movies) were found to be liable for the infringing activities of their users, on the basis of joint tort liability, authorisation liability and communication to the public.]
 
Kaschke v Gray [2010] EWHC 690 (QB)
[defamation, blog, blog comments, liability, hosting exemption]
 
[The case revolved around the liability of a blog owner for the defamatory comment posted on his website. It was held that checking the spelling and grammar of such user-generated content triggers the finding of facts and circumstances from which the existence of infringing content should have been inferred; preventing the blog owner from relying on the “hosting” safe harbour of the E-Commerce Regulations 2002 (see above)].
 
R. v Allan Ellis T20087573 (2010) (at Middlesborough Crown Court)
[copyright, torrent site, criminal infringement, liability, mere conduit exemption]
 
[On the basis of the infringing activities occurring on his website, the operator of Oink’s Pink Palace (which was a BitTorrent-oriented music sharing website running a torrent tracker) was charged with conspiracy to defraud. The court found that the defendant operator acted dishonestly and refused to apply the E-Commerce Regulations’ “mere conduit” safe harbour (see above), stating that this provision is aimed at principally legitimate operations, and Oink’s Pink Palace doesn’t count as such. However, the defendant was ultimately acquitted by the jury.]
 
R. v Rock and Overton (2010) T20087573 (at Gloucester Crown Court)
[copyright, streaming, indexing service, criminal infringement, liability, mere conduit exemption]
 
[The operator of a website known as TV Links (which facilitated copyright-infringing activities by hosting links to 3rd party streaming websites) was charged with conspiracy to defraud. The judge initially considered TV Links to lie outside of the E-Commerce Regulations’ “mere conduit” safe harbour (see above), since he saw the website’s operators as assisting their users in infringing activities, and recital 44 of the E-Commerce Directive states that “a service provider who deliberately collaborates with one of the recipients of his service in order to undertake illegal acts goes beyond the activities of ‘mere conduit’ or ‘caching’ and as a result cannot benefit from the liability exemptions established for these activities.” However, the defendants were ultimately able to rely on the reg. 17, for the E-Commerce Regulations did not transpose rec. 44 into the UK law.]
 
L’Oreal v eBay [2009] EWHC 1094 (Ch)
[trademark, hosting provider, infringement>, joint tort liability]
 
[Operator of an auction website was not found liable in joint tort liability for failing to prevent trademark-infringing actions of its users, who sold counterfeit goods bearing the claimant’s trademark through the defendant’s website. The case was nevertheless stayed, and referred to the CJEU on matters of EU-law based trademark infringement, liability limitation and preventive measures; the latter decision can be found in the EU section of the WILMap. Following the CJEU judgement, the UK case was settled.]
 
Metropolitan International Schools Ltd v Designtechnica Corp [2009] EWHC 1765 Q.B.
[defamation, online forum, indexing service, injunction, liability]
 
[This case was triggered by the appearance of defamatory comments on an online bulletin board, provided by the website operated by the first defendant. Apart from bringing the case against the said operator, the claimant also decided to sue the Google search engine (as a secondary defendant), due to the fact that the defamatory material could have appeared among the latter’s search results, in the form of a “snippet.” The claimant sought, among others, to obtain an injunction restraining the secondary defendant from “publishing or causing to be published or authorising to be published the same or similar words defamatory of the claimant within the jurisdiction of the court.” This request ended up being dismissed, since it was dependent on finding Google liable as a publisher, and the judge found that - in the factual circumstances at hand - the operator of a search engine could not be subjected to such liability.]
 
Bunt v Tilley [2006] EWHC 407 (QB)
[defamation, Usenet, liability, ISPs]
 
[This case saw three British ISPs (AOL, Tiscali and BT) being placed at the crosshair of publisher’s liability for defamatory posts shared through the Usenet newsgroups, due to the fact that the said ISPs provided the Internet connection to users who posted the defamatory material in question. The court found that the three ISPs cannot be regarded as publishers of the defamatory statements – instead, they should be seen as passive facilitators, lying outside of the scope of publisher’s liability.]
 
Jameel v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] EWCA Civ 75
[defamation, newspapers, liability, freedom of expression]
 
[In this case, a defamatory article was posted on the website of the Wall Street Journal Online. The claim against Dow Jones (the publisher of the WSJ) failed due to the finding that no real and substantial tort was committed (only five people were proven to have read the defamatory content, what minimised the damage to reputation), and allowing the case to proceed would constitute an abuse of process.]
 
Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd [1999] EWHC QB 244
[defamation, Usenet, liability, ISPs]
 
[In the case of Godfrey v Demon Internet, a forged posting was shared through the soc.culture.thai Usenet newsgroup by someone pretending to be the claimant. The latter decided to sue the ISP operating the aforementioned newsgroup, for it did not respond to the notice of infringement made by the claimant, allowing the defamatory content to remain available for 10 days (until its automatic expiry). Demon Internet was found to be liable - it was held that as soon as an online service provider becomes aware (ie. acquires actual knowledge) of the defamatory use of its service, it becomes liable as a publisher of the defamatory information. Then, it has to remove the said content expeditiously, in order to prevent the further dissemination of the defamatory material – or incur further liability.]
